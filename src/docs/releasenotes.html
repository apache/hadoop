     Major bug reported by tgraves and fixed by tgraves (tasktracker)<br>
     <b>Recognize Jetty bug 1342 and handle it</b><br>
     <blockquote>We are seeing many instances of the Jetty-1342 (http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/JETTY-1342). The bug doesn&apos;t cause Jetty to stop responding altogether, some fetches go through but a lot of them throw exceptions and eventually fail. The only way we have found to get the TT out of this state is to restart the TT.  This jira is to catch this particular exception (or perhaps a configurable regex) and handle it in an automated way to either blacklist or shutdown the TT after seeing it a configurable number of them.<br></blockquote></li>

     <blockquote>Currently, userlogs directory in TaskTracker is placed under hadoop.log.dir like &lt;hadoop.log.dir&gt;/userlogs. I am proposing to spread these userlogs onto multiple configured mapred.local.dirs to strengthen TaskTracker reliability w.r.t disk failures.  </blockquote></li>

     Major improvement reported by bharathm and fixed by ravidotg (task-controller, tasktracker)<br>
     <b>TaskTracker should handle disk failures at both startup and runtime</b><br>
     <blockquote>At present, TaskTracker doesn&apos;t handle disk failures properly both at startup and runtime.<br><br>(1) Currently TaskTracker doesn&apos;t come up if any of the mapred-local-dirs is on a bad disk. TaskTracker should ignore that particular mapred-local-dir and start up and use only the remaining good mapred-local-dirs.<br>(2) If a disk goes bad while TaskTracker is running, currently TaskTracker doesn&apos;t do anything special. This results in either<br>   (a) TaskTracker continues to &quot;try to use that bad disk&quot; and this results in lots of task failures and possibly job failures(because of multiple TTs having bad disks) and eventually these TTs getting graylisted for all jobs. And this needs manual restart of TT with modified configuration of mapred-local-dirs avoiding the bad disk. OR<br>   (b) Health check script identifying the disk as bad and the TT gets blacklisted. And this also needs manual restart of TT with modified configuration of mapred-local-dirs avoiding the bad disk.<br><br>This JIRA is to make TaskTracker more fault-tolerant to disk failures solving (1) and (2). i.e. TT should start even if at least one of the mapred-local-dirs is on a good disk and TT should adjust its in-memory list of mapred-local-dirs and avoid using bad mapred-local-dirs.<br></blockquote></li>

     Blocker bug reported by amar_kamat and fixed by amareshwari (client)<br>
     <b>Job.getJobID() will always return null</b><br>
     <blockquote>JobContext is used for a read-only view of job&apos;s info. Hence all the readonly fields in JobContext are set in the constructor. Job extends JobContext. When a Job is created, jobid is not known and hence there is no way to set JobID once Job is created. JobID is obtained only when the JobClient queries the jobTracker for a job-id., which happens later i.e upon job submission.</blockquote></li>

     Minor bug reported by mattf and fixed by mattf (name-node)<br>
     <b>TestHDFSServerPorts unit test failure - race condition in FSNamesystem.close() causes NullPointerException without serious consequence</b><br>
     <blockquote>In 20.204, TestHDFSServerPorts was observed to intermittently throw a NullPointerException.  This only happens when FSNamesystem.close() is called, which means system termination for the Namenode, so this is not a serious bug for .204.  TestHDFSServerPorts is more likely than normal execution to stimulate the race, because it runs two Namenodes in the same JVM, causing more interleaving and more potential to see a race condition.<br><br>The race is in FSNamesystem.close(), line 566, we have:<br>      if (replthread != null) replthread.interrupt();<br>      if (replmon != null) replmon = null;<br><br>Since the interrupted replthread is not waited on, there is a potential race condition with replmon being nulled before replthread is dead, but replthread references replmon in computeDatanodeWork() where the NullPointerException occurs.<br><br>The solution is either to wait on replthread or just don&apos;t null replmon.  The latter is preferred, since none of the sibling Namenode processing threads are waited on in close().<br><br>I&apos;ll attach a patch for .205.<br></blockquote></li>

     Major sub-task reported by mattf and fixed by mattf (data-node)<br>
     <b>Namenode should ignore non-initial block reports from datanodes when in safemode during startup</b><br>
     <blockquote>Consider a large cluster that takes 40 minutes to start up.  The datanodes compete to register and send their Initial Block Reports (IBRs) as fast as they can after startup (subject to a small sub-two-minute random delay, which isn&apos;t relevant to this discussion).  <br><br>As each datanode succeeds in sending its IBR, it schedules the starting time for its regular cycle of reports, every hour (or other configured value of dfs.blockreport.intervalMsec). In order to spread the reports evenly across the block report interval, each datanode picks a random fraction of that interval, for the starting point of its regular report cycle.  For example, if a particular datanode ends up randomly selecting 18 minutes after the hour, then that datanode will send a Block Report at 18 minutes after the hour every hour as long as it remains up.  Other datanodes will start their cycles at other randomly selected times.  This code is in DataNode.blockReport() and DataNode.scheduleBlockReport().<br><br>The &quot;second Block Report&quot; (2BR), is the start of these hourly reports.  The problem is that some of these 2BRs get scheduled sooner rather than later, and actually occur within the startup period.  For example, if the cluster takes 40 minutes (2/3 of an hour) to start up, then out of the datanodes that succeed in sending their IBRs during the first 10 minutes, between 1/2 and 2/3 of them will send their 2BR before the 40-minute startup time has completed!<br><br>2BRs sent within the startup time actually compete with the remaining IBRs, and thereby slow down the overall startup process.  This can be seen in the following data, which shows the startup process for a 3700-node cluster that took about 17 minutes to finish startup:<br><br>{noformat}<br>      time    starts  sum   regs  sum   IBR  sum  2nd_BR sum total_BRs/min<br>0   1299799498  3042  3042  1969  1969  151   151          0  151<br>1   1299799558   665  3707  1470  3439  248   399          0  248<br>2   1299799618        3707   224  3663  270   669          0  270<br>3   1299799678        3707    14  3677  261   930    3     3  264<br>4   1299799738        3707    23  3700  288  1218    1     4  289<br>5   1299799798        3707     7  3707  258  1476    3     7  261<br>6   1299799858        3707        3707  317  1793    4    11  321<br>7   1299799918        3707        3707  292  2085    6    17  298<br>8   1299799978        3707        3707  292  2377    8    25  300<br>9   1299800038        3707        3707  272  2649         25  272<br>10  1299800098        3707        3707  280  2929   15    40  295<br>11  1299800158        3707        3707  223  3152   14    54  237<br>12  1299800218        3707        3707  143  3295         54  143<br>13  1299800278        3707        3707  141  3436   20    74  161<br>14  1299800338        3707        3707  195  3631   78   152  273<br>15  1299800398        3707        3707   51  3682  209   361  260<br>16  1299800458        3707        3707   25  3707  369   730  394<br>17  1299800518        3707        3707       3707  166   896  166<br>18  1299800578        3707        3707       3707   72   968   72<br>19  1299800638        3707        3707       3707   67  1035   67<br>20  1299800698        3707        3707       3707   75  1110   75<br>21  1299800758        3707        3707       3707   71  1181   71<br>22  1299800818        3707        3707       3707   67  1248   67<br>23  1299800878        3707        3707       3707   62  1310   62<br>24  1299800938        3707        3707       3707   56  1366   56<br>25  1299800998        3707        3707       3707   60  1426   60<br>{noformat}<br><br>This data was harvested from the startup logs of all the datanodes, and correlated into one-minute buckets.  Each row of the table represents the progress during one elapsed minute of clock time.  It seems that every cluster startup is different, but this one showed the effect fairly well.<br><br>The &quot;starts&quot; column shows that all the nodes started up within the first 2 minutes, and the &quot;regs&quot; column shows that all succeeded in registering by minute 6.  The IBR column shows a sustained rate of Initial Block Report processing of 250-300/minute for the first 10 minutes.<br><br>The question is why, during minutes 11 through 16, the rate of IBR processing slowed down.  Why didn&apos;t the startup just finish?  In the &quot;2nd_BR&quot; column, we see the rate of 2BRs ramping up as more datanodes complete their IBRs.  As the rate increases, they become more effective at competing with the IBRs, and slow down the IBR processing even more.  After the IBRs finally finish in minute 16, the rate of 2BRs settles down to a steady ~60-70/minute.<br><br>In order to decrease competition for locks and other resources, to speed up IBR processing during startup, we propose to delay 2BRs until later into the cycle.</blockquote></li>

Requesting decommissioning page, sometimes, dead page is returned.<br><br>The root cause of this problem is that JSP page is not thread safe by default.  When multiple requests come in,  each request is assigned to a different thread, multiple threads access the same instance of the servlet class resulted from a JSP page.  A class variable is shared by multiple threads.  The JSP code in 20 branche, for example, dfsnodelist.jsp has<br>{code}<br>&lt;!%<br>  int rowNum = 0;<br>  int colNum = 0;<br>  String sorterField = null;<br>  String sorterOrder = null;<br>  String whatNodes = &quot;LIVE&quot;;<br>  ...<br>%&gt;<br>{code}<br><br>declared as  class variables.  ( These set of variables are declared within &lt;%! code %&gt; directives which made them class members. )  Multiple threads share the same set of class member variables, one request would step on anther&apos;s toe. <br><br>However, due to the JSP code refactor, HADOOP-5857, all of these class member variables are moved to become function local variables.  So this bug does not appear in Apache trunk.  Hence, we have proposed to take a simple fix for this bug on 20 branch alone, to be more specific, branch-0.20-security.<br><br>The simple fix is to add jsp ThreadSafe=&quot;false&quot; directive into the related JSP pages, dfshealth.jsp and dfsnodelist.jsp to make them thread safe, i.e. only on request is processed at each time. <br><br>We did evaluate the thread safety issue for other JSP pages on trunk, we noticed a potential problem is that when we retrieving some statistics from namenode, for example, we make the call to <br>{code}<br>NamenodeJspHelper.getInodeLimitText(fsn);<br>{code}<br>in dfshealth.jsp, which eventuality is <br><br>{code}<br>  static String getInodeLimitText(FSNamesystem fsn) {<br>    long inodes = fsn.dir.totalInodes();<br>    long blocks = fsn.getBlocksTotal();<br>    long maxobjects = fsn.getMaxObjects();<br>    ....<br>{code}<br><br>some of the function calls are already guarded by readwritelock, e.g. dir.totalInodes, but others are not.  As a result of this, the web ui results are not 100% thread safe.  But after evaluating the prons and cons of adding a giant lock into the JSP pages, we decided not to issue FSNamesystem ReadWrite locks into JSPs.<br><br></blockquote></li>

     <b>Batch the calls in DataStorage to FileUtil.createHardLink(), so we call it once per directory instead of once per file</b><br>
     <blockquote>It was a bit of a puzzle why we can do a full scan of a disk in about 30 seconds during FSDir() or getVolumeMap(), but the same disk took 11 minutes to do Upgrade replication via hardlinks.  It turns out that the org.apache.hadoop.fs.FileUtil.createHardLink() method does an outcall to Runtime.getRuntime().exec(), to utilize native filesystem hardlink capability.  So it is forking a full-weight external process, and we call it on each individual file to be replicated.<br><br>As a simple check on the possible cost of this approach, I built a Perl test script (under Linux on a production-class datanode).  Perl also uses a compiled and optimized p-code engine, and it has both native support for hardlinks and the ability to do &quot;exec&quot;.  <br>-  A simple script to create 256,000 files in a directory tree organized like the Datanode, took 10 seconds to run.<br>-  Replicating that directory tree using hardlinks, the same way as the Datanode, took 12 seconds using native hardlink support.<br>-  The same replication using outcalls to exec, one per file, took 256 seconds!<br>-  Batching the calls, and doing &apos;exec&apos; once per directory instead of once per file, took 16 seconds.<br><br>Obviously, your mileage will vary based on the number of blocks per volume.  A volume with less than about 4000 blocks will have only 65 directories.  A volume with more than 4K and less than about 250K blocks will have 4200 directories (more or less).  And there are two files per block (the data file and the .meta file).  So the average number of files per directory may vary from 2:1 to 500:1.  A node with 50K blocks and four volumes will have 25K files per volume, or an average of about 6:1.  So this change may be expected to take it down from, say, 12 minutes per volume to 2.<br></blockquote></li>

     <b>Quota bug for partial blocks allows quotas to be violated </b><br>
     <blockquote>There&apos;s a bug in the quota code that causes them not to be respected when a file is not an exact multiple of the block size. Here&apos;s an example:<br><br>{code}<br>$ hadoop fs -mkdir /test<br>$ hadoop dfsadmin -setSpaceQuota 384M /test<br>$ ls dir/ | wc -l   # dir contains 101 files<br>101<br>$ du -ms dir        # each is 3mb<br>304	dir<br>$ hadoop fs -put dir /test<br>$ hadoop fs -count -q /test<br>        none             inf       402653184      -550502400            2          101          317718528 hdfs://haus01.sf.cloudera.com:10020/test<br>$ hadoop fs -stat &quot;%o %r&quot; /test/dir/f30<br>134217728 3    # three 128mb blocks<br>{code}<br><br>INodeDirectoryWithQuota caches the number of bytes consumed by it&apos;s children in {{diskspace}}. The quota adjustment code has a bug that causes {{diskspace}} to get updated incorrectly when a file is not an exact multiple of the block size (the value ends up being negative). <br><br>This causes the quota checking code to think that the files in the directory consumes less space than they actually do, so the verifyQuota does not throw a QuotaExceededException even when the directory is over quota. However the bug isn&apos;t visible to users because {{fs count -q}} reports the numbers generated by INode#getContentSummary which adds up the sizes of the blocks rather than use the cached INodeDirectoryWithQuota#diskspace value.<br><br>In FSDirectory#addBlock the disk space consumed is set conservatively to the full block size * the number of replicas:<br><br>{code}<br>updateCount(inodes, inodes.length-1, 0,<br>    fileNode.getPreferredBlockSize()*fileNode.getReplication(), true);<br>{code}<br><br>In FSNameSystem#addStoredBlock we adjust for this conservative estimate by subtracting out the difference between the conservative estimate and what the number of bytes actually stored was:<br><br>{code}<br>//Updated space consumed if required.<br>INodeFile file = (storedBlock != null) ? storedBlock.getINode() : null;<br>long diff = (file == null) ? 0 :<br>    (file.getPreferredBlockSize() - storedBlock.getNumBytes());<br><br>if (diff &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; file.isUnderConstruction() &amp;&amp;<br>    cursize &lt; storedBlock.getNumBytes()) {<br>...<br>    dir.updateSpaceConsumed(path, 0, -diff*file.getReplication());<br>{code}<br><br>We do the same in FSDirectory#replaceNode when completing the file, but at a file granularity (I believe the intent here is to correct for the cases when there&apos;s a failure replicating blocks and recovery). Since oldnode is under construction INodeFile#diskspaceConsumed will use the preferred block size  (vs of Block#getNumBytes used by newnode) so we will again subtract out the difference between the full block size and what the number of bytes actually stored was:<br><br>{code}<br>long dsOld = oldnode.diskspaceConsumed();<br>...<br>//check if disk space needs to be updated.<br>long dsNew = 0;<br>if (updateDiskspace &amp;&amp; (dsNew = newnode.diskspaceConsumed()) != dsOld) {<br>  try {<br>    updateSpaceConsumed(path, 0, dsNew-dsOld);<br>...<br>{code}<br><br>So in the above example we started with diskspace at 384mb (3 * 128mb) and then we subtract 375mb (to reflect only 9mb raw was actually used) twice so for each file the diskspace for the directory is - 366mb (384mb minus 2 * 375mb). Which is why the quota gets negative and yet we can still write more files.<br><br>So a directory with lots of single block files (if you have multiple blocks on the final partial block ends up subtracting from the diskspace used) ends up having a quota that&apos;s way off.<br><br>I think the fix is to in FSDirectory#replaceNode not have the diskspaceConsumed calculations differ when the old and new INode have the same blocks. I&apos;ll work on a patch which also adds a quota test for blocks that are not multiples of the block size and warns in INodeDirectory#computeContentSummary if the computed size does not reflect the cached value.</blockquote></li>

    happens. The bug was that even if commit failed, the task would be
    declared as successful. Contributed by Amareshwari Sriramadasu.

<li> <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MAPREDUCE-809 ">MAPREDUCE-809 </a>Fix job-summary logs to correctly record final status of 
    FAILED and KILLED jobs.

<li> <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MAPREDUCE-771 ">MAPREDUCE-771 </a>Fixes a bug which delays normal jobs in favor of
    high-ram jobs.

<li> <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-5420">HADOOP-5420</a> Support setsid based kill in LinuxTaskController.

<li> <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MAPREDUCE-733 ">MAPREDUCE-733 </a>Fixes a bug that when a task tracker is killed ,
    it throws exception. Instead it should catch it and process it and

    for HiRAM job tasks than required.

<li> <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MAPREDUCE-683 ">MAPREDUCE-683 </a>TestJobTrackerRestart failed because of stale
    filemanager cache (which was created once per jvm). This patch makes
    sure that the filemanager is inited upon every JobHistory.init()
    and hence upon every restart. Note that this wont happen in production
    as upon a restart the new jobtracker will start in a new jvm and
    hence a new cache will be created.

<li> <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-5980">HADOOP-5980</a> Previously, task spawned off by LinuxTaskController
    didn't get LD_LIBRARY_PATH in their environment. The tasks will now
    get same LD_LIBRARY_PATH value as when spawned off by
    DefaultTaskController.

<li> <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-5981">HADOOP-5981</a> This issue completes the feature mentioned in
    <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-2838">HADOOP-2838</a>. <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-2838">HADOOP-2838</a> provided a way to set env variables in
    child process. This issue provides a way to inherit tt's env variables
    and append or reset it. So now X=$X:y will inherit X (if there) and
    append y to it.

<li> <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-5419">HADOOP-5419</a>  This issue is to provide an improvement on the
    existing M/R framework to let users know which queues they have
    access to, and for what operations. One use case for this would
    that currently there is no easy way to know if the user has access
    to submit jobs to a queue, until it fails with an access control
    exception.

<li> <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-5420">HADOOP-5420</a> Support setsid based kill in LinuxTaskController.

<li> <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-5643">HADOOP-5643</a> Added the functionality to refresh jobtrackers node
    list via command line (bin/hadoop mradmin -refreshNodes). The command
    should be run as the jobtracker owner (jobtracker process owner)
    or from a super group (mapred.permissions.supergroup).

<li> <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-2838">HADOOP-2838</a> Now the users can set environment variables using
    mapred.child.env. They can do the following X=Y : set X to Y X=$X:Y
    : Append Y to X (which should be taken from the tasktracker)
