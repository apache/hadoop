  <title>Preface</title>

  <para>This book aims to be the official guide for the <link
  xlink:href="http://hbase.apache.org/">HBase</link> version it ships with.
  This document describes HBase version <emphasis><?eval ${project.version}?></emphasis>.
  Herein you will find either the definitive documentation on an HBase topic
  as of its standing when the referenced HBase version shipped, or this book
  will point to the location in <link
  xlink:href="http://hbase.apache.org/docs/current/api/index.html">javadoc</link>,
  <link xlink:href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE">JIRA</link>
  or <link xlink:href="http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/Hbase">wiki</link> where
  the pertinent information can be found.</para>

  <para>This book is a work in progress.  Feel free to add to this book by adding
  a patch to an issue up in the HBase <link

      <title>Heads-up</title>
      <para>
          If this is your first foray into the wonderful world of
          Distributed Computing, then you are in for
          some interesting times.  First off, distributed systems are
          hard; making a distributed system hum requires a disparate
          skillset that needs span systems (hardware and software) and
          networking.  Your cluster' operation can hiccup because of any
          of a myriad set of reasons from bugs in HBase itself through misconfigurations
          -- misconfiguration of HBase but also operating system misconfigurations --
          through to hardware problems whether it be a bug in your network card
          drivers or an underprovisioned RAM bus (to mention two recent
          examples of hardware issues that manifested as "HBase is slow").
          You will also need to do a recalibration if up to this your
          computing has been bound to a single box.  Here is one good
          starting point:
