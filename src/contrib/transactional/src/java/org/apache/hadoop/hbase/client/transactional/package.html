This package provides support for atomic transactions. Transactions can
span multiple regions. Transaction writes are applied when committing a
transaction. At commit time, the transaction is examined to see if it
can be applied while still maintaining atomicity. This is done by
looking for conflicts with the transactions that committed while the
current transaction was running. This technique is known as optimistic
concurrency control (OCC) because it relies on the assumption that
transactions will mostly not have conflicts with each other.

<p>
For more details on OCC, see the paper <i> On Optimistic Methods for Concurrency Control </i> 
by Kung and Robinson available 
<a href=http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~zives/cis650/papers/opt-cc.pdf> here </a>.

<p> To enable transactions, modify hbase-site.xml to turn on the
TransactionalRegionServer.  This is done by setting
<i>hbase.regionserver.class</i> to
<i>org.apache.hadoop.hbase.ipc.TransactionalRegionInterface</i> and
<i>hbase.regionserver.impl </i> to
<i>org.apache.hadoop.hbase.regionserver.transactional.TransactionalRegionServer</i>

<p> 
The read set claimed by a transactional scanner is determined from the start and
 end keys which the scanner is opened with. 



<h3> Known Issues </h3>

Recovery in the face of hregion server failure
is not fully implemented. Thus, you cannot rely on the transactional
properties in the face of node failure.
