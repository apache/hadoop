<h1>Multi Data Center Replication</h1>
This package provides replication between HBase clusters.

<h2>Status</h2>
</a>
<p>
This package isn't even alpha quality software and is only meant to be a base
for future developments. The current implementation offers the following
features:

<ol>
    <li>Master/Slave replication limited to 1 slave. </li>
    <li>Replication of all user tables.</li>
    <li>Start/stop replication stream.</li>
    <li>Supports cluters of different sizes.</li>
    <li>Re-replication of entries from failed region
        servers on the master cluster.</li>
</ol>
Please report bugs on the project's Jira when found.
<p>
<a name="requirements">
<h2>Requirements</h2>
</a>
<p>

Before trying out replication, make sure to review the following requirements:

<ol>
    <li>Zookeeper should be handled by yourself, not by HBase, and should
    always be available during the deployment. Currently you can't use
    zoo.cfg to hold your Zookeeper configurations.</li>
    <li>All machines from both clusters should be able to reach every
    other machine since replication goes from any region server to any
    other one on the slave cluster. That also includes the
    Zookeeper clusters.</li>
    <li>Both clusters should have the same HBase and Hadoop major revision.
    For example, having 0.21.1 on the master and 0.21.0 on the slave is
    correct but not 0.21.1 and 0.22.0.</li>
    <li>Every table should exist with the exact same name and column
    family names on both clusters.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Deployment</h2>

The following steps describe how to enable replication from a cluster
to another. This must be done with both clusters offlined.
<ol>
    <li>Copy the hbase-0.21.0-dev-mdc_replication.jar file from the
    $HBASE_HOME/contrib/mdc_replication/ folder to $HBASE_HOME/lib on
    both clusters.</li>
    <li>Edit ${HBASE_HOME}/conf/hbase-site.xml on both cluster to add
    the following configurations:
        <pre>
&lt;property&gt;
  &lt;name&gt;hbase.regionserver.class&lt;/name&gt;
  &lt;value&gt;org.apache.hadoop.hbase.ipc.ReplicationRegionInterface&lt;/value&gt;
&lt;/property&gt;
&lt;property&gt;
  &lt;name&gt;hbase.regionserver.impl&lt;/name&gt;
  &lt;value&gt;org.apache.hadoop.hbase.regionserver.replication.ReplicationRegionServer&lt;/value&gt;
&lt;/property&gt;</pre>
    </li>
    <li>Run the following command on any cluster:
    <pre>
$HBASE_HOME/bin/hbase org.jruby.Main $HBASE_HOME/src/contrib/mdc_replication/bin/add_peer.tb</pre>
    This will show you the help to setup the replication stream between
    both clusters. If both clusters use the same Zookeeper cluster, you have
    to use a different <b>zookeeper.znode.parent</b> since they can't
    write in the same folder.
    </li>
    <li>You can now start and stop the clusters with your preferred method.</li>
</ol>

You can confirm that your setup works by looking at any region server's log
on the master cluster and look for the following lines;

<pre>
Considering 1 rs, with ratio 0.1
Getting 1 rs from peer cluster # 0
Choosing peer 10.10.1.49:62020</pre>

In this case it indicates that 1 region server from the slave cluster
was chosen for replication.<br><br>

Should you want to stop the replication while the clusters are running, open
the shell on the master cluster and issue this command:
<pre>
hbase(main):001:0> zk 'set /zookeeper.znode.parent/replication/state false'</pre>

Where you replace the znode parent with the one configured on your master
cluster. Replication of already queued edits will still happen after you
issued that command but new entries won't be. To start it back, simply replace
"false" with "true" in the command.
