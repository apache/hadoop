The Sqoop Command Line
----------------------

To execute Sqoop, run with Hadoop:
----
$ bin/hadoop jar contrib/sqoop/hadoop-$(version)-sqoop.jar (arguments)
----

NOTE:Throughput this document, we will use `sqoop` as shorthand for the
above. i.e., `$ sqoop (arguments)`

You pass this program options describing the
import job you want to perform. If you need a hint, running Sqoop with
`--help` will print out a list of all the command line
options available. The +sqoop(1)+ manual page will also describe
Sqoop's available arguments in greater detail. The manual page is built
in `$HADOOP_HOME/build/contrib/sqoop/doc/sqoop.1.gz`.
The following subsections will describe the most common modes of operation.
