Controlling the Output Format
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
include::output-formatting.txt[]

The following arguments allow you to control the output format of
records:

include::output-formatting-args.txt[]

For example, we may want to separate records by tab characters, with
every record surrounded by "double quotes", and internal quote marks
escaped by a backslash (+\+) character:

----
$ sqoop --connect jdbc:mysql://database.example.com/employees \
  --table employee_names --fields-terminated-by \t \
  --lines-terminated-by \n --enclosed-by '\"' --escaped-by '\\'
----
