      <title>6 February, 2006: nightly builds</title>
      <p>Hadoop now has nightly builds.  This automatically creates a
      <a href="ext:nightly">downloadable version of Hadoop every
      night</a>.  All unit tests must pass, or a message is sent to
      the developers mailing list and no new version is created.  This
      also updates the <a href="docs/api/">javadoc</a>.</p>
