    <p>
    HBase is the <a href="http://hadoop.apache.org">Hadoop</a> database. Use it when you need random, realtime read/write access to your Big Data.
    This project's goal is the hosting of very large tables -- billions of rows X millions of columns -- atop clusters of commodity hardware.

HBase is an open-source, distributed, versioned, column-oriented store modeled after Google' <a hef="http://labs.google.com/papers/bigtable.html">Bigtable: A Distributed Storage System for Structured</a> by Chang et al. Just as Bigtable leverages the distributed data storage provided by the Google File System, HBase provides Bigtable-like capabilities on top of Hadoop.
HBase includes:
<ul>
    <li>Convenient base classes for backing Hadoop MapReduce jobs with HBase tables including cascading, hive and pig source and sink modules
</li>
    <li>Query predicate push down via server side scan and get filters
</li>
    <li>Optimizations for real time queries
</li>
    <li>A Thrift gateway and a REST-ful Web service that supports XML, Protobuf, and binary data encoding options
</li>
    <li>Extensible jruby-based (JIRB) shell
</li>
    <li>Support for exporting metrics via the Hadoop metrics subsystem to files or Ganglia; or via JMX
</li>
</ul>
