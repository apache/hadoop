Provides an HBase <a href="http://developers.facebook.com/thrift/">Thrift</a>
service.

This directory contains a Thrift interface definition file for an Hbase RPC
service and a Java server implementation.

<h2><a name="whatisthrift">What is Thrift?</a></h2> 

<p>"Thrift is a software framework for scalable cross-language services
development. It combines a powerful software stack with a code generation
engine to build services that work efficiently and seamlessly between C++,
Java, Python, PHP, and Ruby. Thrift was developed at Facebook, and we are now
releasing it as open source."  For additional information, see
http://developers.facebook.com/thrift/.  Facebook has announced their intent
to migrate Thrift into Apache Incubator.
</p>

<h2><a name="description">Description</a></h2>

<p>The <a href="generated/Hbase.Iface.html">Hbase API</a> is defined in the
file Hbase.thrift.  A server-side implementation of the API is in {@link
org.apache.hadoop.hbase.thrift.ThriftServer}.  The generated interfaces,
types, and RPC utility files are checked into SVN under the {@link
org.apache.hadoop.hbase.thrift.generated} directory.

</p>

<p>The files were generated by running the commands:
<pre>
  thrift -strict --gen java Hbase.thrift
  mv gen-java/org/apache/hadoop/hbase/thrift/generated .
  rm -rf gen-java
</pre>
</p>

<p>The 'thrift' binary is the Thrift compiler, and it is distributed as a part
of
the Thrift package.  Additionally, specific language runtime libraries are a
part of the Thrift package.  A version of the Java runtime is checked into SVN
under the hbase/lib directory.
</p>

<p>To start ThriftServer, use:
<pre>
  ./bin/hbase-daemon.sh start thrift [--port=PORT]
</pre>
The default port is 9090.
</p>

<p>To stop, use:
<pre>
  ./bin/hbase-daemon.sh stop thrift
</pre>
