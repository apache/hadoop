 * We need to provide the ability to the code in fs/kfs without really
 * having a KFS deployment.  In particular, the glue code that wraps
 * around calls to KfsAccess object.  This is accomplished by defining a
 * filesystem implementation interface:  
 *   -- for testing purposes, a dummy implementation of this interface
 * will suffice; as long as the dummy implementation is close enough
 * to doing what KFS does, we are good.
 *   -- for deployment purposes with KFS, this interface is
 * implemented by the KfsImpl object.
