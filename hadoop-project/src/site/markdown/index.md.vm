Apache Hadoop ${project.version}
================================

Apache Hadoop ${project.version} consists of significant
improvements over the previous stable release (hadoop-1.x).

Here is a short overview of the improvments to both HDFS and MapReduce.

* HDFS Federation

    In order to scale the name service horizontally, federation uses
    multiple independent Namenodes/Namespaces. The Namenodes are
    federated, that is, the Namenodes are independent and don't require
    coordination with each other. The datanodes are used as common storage
    for blocks by all the Namenodes. Each datanode registers with all the
    Namenodes in the cluster. Datanodes send periodic heartbeats and block
    reports and handles commands from the Namenodes.

    More details are available in the
    [HDFS Federation](./hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-hdfs/Federation.html)
    document.

* MapReduce NextGen aka YARN aka MRv2

    The new architecture introduced in hadoop-0.23, divides the two major
    functions of the JobTracker: resource management and job life-cycle
    management into separate components.
    
    The new ResourceManager manages the global assignment of compute
    resources to applications and the per-application
    ApplicationMaster manages the application‚ scheduling and
    coordination.

    An application is either a single job in the sense of classic
    MapReduce jobs or a DAG of such jobs.

    The ResourceManager and per-machine NodeManager daemon, which
    manages the user processes on that machine, form the computation
    fabric.

    The per-application ApplicationMaster is, in effect, a framework
    specific library and is tasked with negotiating resources from the
    ResourceManager and working with the NodeManager(s) to execute and
    monitor the tasks.

    More details are available in the
    [YARN](./hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-site/YARN.html) document.

Getting Started
===============

The Hadoop documentation includes the information you need to get started using
Hadoop. Begin with the 
[Single Node Setup](./hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-common/SingleCluster.html)
which shows you how to set up a single-node Hadoop installation.
Then move on to the
[Cluster Setup](./hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-common/ClusterSetup.html)
to learn how to set up a multi-node Hadoop installation.
