Apache Hadoop ${project.version}
================================

Apache Hadoop ${project.version} is a minor release in the 2.x.y release
line, building upon the previous stable release 2.7.1.

Here is a short overview of the major features and improvements.

*   Common

    *   Authentication improvements when using an HTTP proxy server. This is
        useful when accessing WebHDFS via a proxy server.

    *   A new Hadoop metrics sink that allows writing directly to Graphite.

    *   [Specification work](./hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-common/filesystem/index.html)
        related to the Hadoop Compatible Filesystem (HCFS) effort.

*   HDFS

    *   Support for POSIX-style filesystem extended attributes. See the
        [user documentation](./hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-hdfs/ExtendedAttributes.html)
        for more details.

    *   Using the OfflineImageViewer, clients can now browse an fsimage via
        the WebHDFS API.

    *   The NFS gateway received a number of supportability improvements and
        bug fixes. The Hadoop portmapper is no longer required to run the gateway,
        and the gateway is now able to reject connections from unprivileged ports.

    *   The SecondaryNameNode, JournalNode, and DataNode web UIs have been
        modernized with HTML5 and Javascript.

*   YARN

    *   YARN's REST APIs now support write/modify operations. Users can submit and
        kill applications through REST APIs.

    *   The timeline store in YARN, used for storing generic and
        application-specific information for applications, supports authentication
        through Kerberos.

    *   The Fair Scheduler supports dynamic hierarchical user queues, user queues
        are created dynamically at runtime under any specified parent-queue.

Getting Started
===============

The Hadoop documentation includes the information you need to get started using
Hadoop. Begin with the
[Single Node Setup](./hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-common/SingleCluster.html) which
shows you how to set up a single-node Hadoop installation. Then move on to the
[Cluster Setup](./hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-common/ClusterSetup.html) to learn how
to set up a multi-node Hadoop installation.
