Overview
========

Metrics are statistical information exposed by Hadoop daemons, used for monitoring, performance tuning and debug. There are many metrics available by default and they are very useful for troubleshooting. This page shows the details of the available metrics.

Each section describes each context into which metrics are grouped.

The documentation of Metrics 2.0 framework is [here](../../api/org/apache/hadoop/metrics2/package-summary.html).

rpcdetailed context
===================

Metrics of rpcdetailed context are exposed in unified manner by RPC layer. Two metrics are exposed for each RPC based on its name. Metrics named "(RPC method name)NumOps" indicates total number of method calls, and metrics named "(RPC method name)AvgTime" shows average processing time for method calls in milliseconds.
Please note that the AvgTime metrics do not include time spent waiting to acquire locks on data structures (see RpcLockWaitTimeAvgTime).
Metrics named "Overall(RPC method name)AvgTime" shows the average overall processing time for method calls
in milliseconds. It is measured from request arrival to when the response is sent back to the client.

FsVolume
--------

Per-volume metrics contain Datanode Volume IO related statistics. Per-volume
metrics are off by default. They can be enabled by setting `dfs.datanode
.fileio.profiling.percentage.fraction` to an integer value between 1 and 100.
Setting this value to 0 would mean profiling is not enabled. But enabling
per-volume metrics may have a performance impact. Each metrics record
contains tags such as Hostname as additional information along with metrics.
