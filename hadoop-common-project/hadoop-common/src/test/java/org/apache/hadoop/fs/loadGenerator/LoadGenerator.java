/** The load generator is a tool for testing NameNode behavior under
 * different client loads. Note there is a subclass of this clas that lets 
 * you run a the load generator as a MapReduce job (see LoadGeneratorMR in the 
 * MapReduce project.
 * 
 * The loadGenerator allows the user to generate different mixes of read, write,
 * and list requests by specifying the probabilities of read and
 * write. The user controls the intensity of the load by
 * adjusting parameters for the number of worker threads and the delay
 * between operations. While load generators are running, the user
 * can profile and monitor the running of the NameNode. When a load
 * generator exits, it print some NameNode statistics like the average
 * execution time of each kind of operations and the NameNode
 * throughput.
 *
 * The program can run in one of two forms. As a regular single process command
 * that runs multiple threads to generate load on the NN or as a Map Reduce
 * program that runs multiple (multi-threaded) map tasks that generate load
 * on the NN; the results summary is generated by a single reduce task.
 * 
 * 
 * The user may either specify constant duration, read and write 
 * probabilities via the command line, or may specify a text file
 * that acts as a script of which read and write probabilities to
 * use for specified durations. If no duration is specified the program
 * runs till killed (duration required if run as MapReduce).
 * 
 * The script takes the form of lines of duration in seconds, read
 * probability and write probability, each separated by white space.
 * Blank lines and lines starting with # (comments) are ignored. If load
 * generator is run as a MapReduce program then the script file needs to be
 * accessible on the the Map task as a HDFS file.
 * 
 * After command line argument parsing and data initialization,
 * the load generator spawns the number of worker threads 
 * as specified by the user.
 * Each thread sends a stream of requests to the NameNode.
 * For each iteration, it first decides if it is going to read a file,
 * create a file, or listing a directory following the read and write 
 * probabilities specified by the user.
 * When reading, it randomly picks a file in the test space and reads
 * the entire file. When writing, it randomly picks a directory in the
 * test space and creates a file whose name consists of the current 
 * machine's host name and the thread id. The length of the file
 * follows Gaussian distribution with an average size of 2 blocks and
 * the standard deviation of 1 block. The new file is filled with 'a'.
 * Immediately after the file creation completes, the file is deleted
 * from the test space.
 * While listing, it randomly picks a directory in the test space and
 * list the directory content.
 * Between two consecutive operations, the thread pauses for a random
 * amount of time in the range of [0, maxDelayBetweenOps] 
 * if the specified max delay is not zero.
 * All threads are stopped when the specified elapsed time has passed 
 * in command-line execution, or all the lines of script have been 
 * executed, if using a script.
 * Before exiting, the program prints the average execution for 
 * each kind of NameNode operations, and the number of requests
 * served by the NameNode.
 *
 * The synopsis of the command is
 * java LoadGenerator
 *   -readProbability <read probability>: read probability [0, 1]
 *                                        with a default value of 0.3333. 
 *   -writeProbability <write probability>: write probability [0, 1]
 *                                         with a default value of 0.3333.
 *   -root <root>: test space with a default value of /testLoadSpace
 *   -maxDelayBetweenOps <maxDelayBetweenOpsInMillis>: 
 *      Max delay in the unit of milliseconds between two operations with a 
 *      default value of 0 indicating no delay.
 *   -numOfThreads <numOfThreads>: 
 *      number of threads to spawn with a default value of 200.
 *   -elapsedTime <elapsedTimeInSecs>: 
 *      the elapsed time of program with a default value of 0 
 *      indicating running forever
 *   -startTime <startTimeInMillis> : when the threads start to run.
 *   -scriptFile <file name>: text file to parse for scripted operation
