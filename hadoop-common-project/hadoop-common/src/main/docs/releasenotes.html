<h2>Changes since Hadoop 2.0.2</h2>
<ul>
<li> <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YARN-372">YARN-372</a>.
     Minor task reported by Siddharth Seth and fixed by Siddharth Seth <br>
     <b>Move InlineDispatcher from hadoop-yarn-server-resourcemanager to hadoop-yarn-common</b><br>
     <blockquote>InlineDispatcher is a utility used in unit tests. Belongs in yarn-common instead of yarn-server-resource-manager.</blockquote></li>
<li> <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YARN-364">YARN-364</a>.
     Major bug reported by Jason Lowe and fixed by Jason Lowe <br>
     <b>AggregatedLogDeletionService can take too long to delete logs</b><br>
     <blockquote>AggregatedLogDeletionService uses the yarn.log-aggregation.retain-seconds property to determine which logs should be deleted, but it uses the same value to determine how often to check for old logs.  This means logs could actually linger up to twice as long as configured.</blockquote></li>
<li> <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YARN-360">YARN-360</a>.
     Critical bug reported by Daryn Sharp and fixed by Daryn Sharp <br>
     <b>Allow apps to concurrently register tokens for renewal</b><br>
     <blockquote>{{DelegationTokenRenewer#addApplication}} has an unnecessary {{synchronized}} keyword.  This serializes job submissions and can add unnecessary latency and/or hang all submissions if there are problems renewing the token.</blockquote></li>
<li> <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YARN-357">YARN-357</a>.
     Major bug reported by Daryn Sharp and fixed by Daryn Sharp (resourcemanager)<br>
     <b>App submission should not be synchronized</b><br>
     <blockquote>MAPREDUCE-2953 fixed a race condition with querying of app status by making {{RMClientService#submitApplication}} synchronously invoke {{RMAppManager#submitApplication}}. However, the {{synchronized}} keyword was also added to {{RMAppManager#submitApplication}} with the comment:
bq. I made the submitApplication synchronized to keep it consistent with the other routines in RMAppManager although I do not believe it needs it since the rmapp datastructure is already a concurrentMap and I don't see anything else that would be an issue.

It's been observed that app submission latency is being unnecessarily impacted.</blockquote></li>
<li> <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YARN-355">YARN-355</a>.
     Blocker bug reported by Daryn Sharp and fixed by Daryn Sharp (resourcemanager)<br>
     <b>RM app submission jams under load</b><br>
     <blockquote>The RM performs a loopback connection to itself to renew its own tokens.  If app submissions consume all RPC handlers for {{ClientRMProtocol}}, then app submissions block because it cannot loopback to itself to do the renewal.</blockquote></li>
<li> <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YARN-354">YARN-354</a>.
     Blocker bug reported by Liang Xie and fixed by Liang Xie <br>
     <b>WebAppProxyServer exits immediately after startup</b><br>
     <blockquote>Please see HDFS-4426 for detail, i found the yarn WebAppProxyServer is broken by HADOOP-9181 as well, here's the hot fix, and i verified manually in our test cluster.

I'm really applogized for bring about such trouble...</blockquote></li>

     Major bug reported by Thomas Graves and fixed by Xuan Gong (capacityscheduler)<br>
     <b>Capacity Scheduler maximum-capacity value -1 is invalid</b><br>

<li> <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YARN-336">YARN-336</a>.
     Major bug reported by Sandy Ryza and fixed by Sandy Ryza (scheduler)<br>
     <b>Fair scheduler FIFO scheduling within a queue only allows 1 app at a time </b><br>
     <blockquote>The fair scheduler allows apps to be scheduled in FIFO fashion within a queue.  Currently, when this setting is turned on, the scheduler only allows one app to run at a time.  While apps submitted earlier should get first priority for allocations, when there is space remaining, other apps should have a change to get at them.</blockquote></li>
<li> <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YARN-334">YARN-334</a>.
     Critical bug reported by Thomas Graves and fixed by Thomas Graves <br>

     <blockquote>yarn side of HADOOP-9097



Running 'mvn apache-rat:check' passes, but running RAT by hand (by downloading the JAR) produces some warnings for Java files, amongst others.

     Blocker bug reported by Jason Lowe and fixed by Arun C Murthy (capacityscheduler)<br>
     <b>RM CapacityScheduler can deadlock when getQueueInfo() is called and a container is completing</b><br>
     <blockquote>If a client calls getQueueInfo on a parent queue (e.g.: the root queue) and containers are completing then the RM can deadlock.  getQueueInfo() locks the ParentQueue and then calls the child queues' getQueueInfo() methods in turn.  However when a container completes, it locks the LeafQueue then calls back into the ParentQueue.  When the two mix, it's a recipe for deadlock.

Stacktrace to follow.</blockquote></li>
<li> <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YARN-320">YARN-320</a>.
     Blocker bug reported by Daryn Sharp and fixed by Daryn Sharp (resourcemanager)<br>
     <b>RM should always be able to renew its own tokens</b><br>
     <blockquote>YARN-280 introduced fast-fail for job submissions with bad tokens.  Unfortunately, other stack components like oozie and customers are acquiring RM tokens with a hardcoded dummy renewer value.  These jobs would fail after 24 hours because the RM token couldn't be renewed, but fast-fail is failing them immediately.  The RM should always be able to renew its own tokens submitted with a job.  The renewer field may continue to specify an external user who can renew.</blockquote></li>

     Major bug reported by Sandy Ryza and fixed by Sandy Ryza (resourcemanager , scheduler)<br>
     <b>Fair scheduler queue doesn't accept any jobs when ACLs are configured.</b><br>
     <blockquote>If a queue is configured with an ACL for who can submit jobs, no jobs are allowed, even if a user on the list tries.

This is caused by using the scheduler thinking the user is "yarn", because it calls UserGroupInformation.getCurrentUser() instead of UserGroupInformation.createRemoteUser() with the given user name.</blockquote></li>

     Major improvement reported by Derek Dagit and fixed by Derek Dagit <br>
     <b>RM should be able to provide a tracking link for apps that have already been purged</b><br>
     <blockquote>As applications complete, the RM tracks their IDs in a completed list.  This list is routinely truncated to limit the total number of application remembered by the RM.

When a user clicks the History for a job, either the browser is redirected to the application's tracking link obtained from the stored application instance.  But when the application has been purged from the RM, an error is displayed.

In very busy clusters the rate at which applications complete can cause applications to be purged from the RM's internal list within hours, which breaks the proxy URLs users have saved for their jobs.

We would like the RM to provide valid tracking links persist so that users are not frustrated by broken links.</blockquote></li>

It would be much more helpful if the proxy URL redirected to the RM webapp page for the specific application.  That page shows the various AM attempts and pointers to their logs which will be useful for debugging the problems that caused the AM attempts to fail.</blockquote></li>

     <b>Add capacity-scheduler-default.xml to provide a default set of configurations for the capacity scheduler.</b><br>

{code}
FATAL org.apache.hadoop.yarn.server.resourcemanager.ResourceManager: Error starting ResourceManager
java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Illegal capacity of -1 for queue root
{code}

Which basically arises from missing basic configurations, which in many cases, there is no need to explicitly provide, and a default configuration will be sufficient. For example, to address the error above, the user need to add a capacity of 100 to the root queue.

So, we need to add a capacity-scheduler-default.xml, this will be helpful to provide the basic set of default configurations required to run the capacity scheduler. The user can still override existing configurations or provide new ones in capacity-scheduler.xml. This is similar to *-default.xml vs *-site.xml for yarn, core, mapred, hdfs, etc.

     <b>Simplify classpath construction for mini YARN tests</b><br>
     <blockquote>The test classpath includes a special file called 'mrapp-generated-classpath' (or similar in distributed shell) that is constructed at build time, and whose contents are a classpath with all the dependencies needed to run the tests. When the classpath for a container (e.g. the AM) is constructed the contents of mrapp-generated-classpath is read and added to the classpath, and the file itself is then added to the classpath so that later when the AM constructs a classpath for a task container it can propagate the test classpath correctly.

This mechanism can be drastically simplified by propagating the system classpath of the current JVM (read from the java.class.path property) to a launched JVM, but only if running in the context of the mini YARN cluster. Any tests that use the mini YARN cluster will automatically work with this change. Although any that explicitly deal with mrapp-generated-classpath can be simplified.

     <b>RM is missing ability to add include/exclude files without a restart</b><br>
     <blockquote>The "yarn.resourcemanager.nodes.include-path" default value is "", if we need to add an include file, we must currently restart the RM. 

I suggest that for adding an include or exclude file, there should be no need to restart the RM. We may only execute the refresh command. The HDFS NameNode already has this ability.

Fix is to the modify HostsFileReader class instances:

From:
{code}
public HostsFileReader(String inFile, 
                         String exFile)
{code}
To:
{code}
 public HostsFileReader(Configuration conf, 
                         String NODES_INCLUDE_FILE_PATH,String DEFAULT_NODES_INCLUDE_FILE_PATH,
                        String NODES_EXCLUDE_FILE_PATH,String DEFAULT_NODES_EXCLUDE_FILE_PATH)
{code}

And thus, we can read the config file dynamically when a {{refreshNodes}} is invoked and therefore have no need to restart the ResourceManager.

     Major bug reported by Andrew Wang and fixed by Andrew Wang <br>
     <b>Make enabling of stale marking on read and write paths independent</b><br>
     <blockquote>This patch makes an incompatible configuration change, as described below:
In releases 1.1.0 and other point releases 1.1.x, the configuration parameter "dfs.namenode.check.stale.datanode" could be used to turn on checking for the stale nodes. This configuration is no longer supported in release 1.2.0 onwards and is renamed as "dfs.namenode.avoid.read.stale.datanode". 

How feature works and configuring this feature:
As described in HDFS-3703 release notes, datanode stale period can be configured using parameter "dfs.namenode.stale.datanode.interval" in seconds (default value is 30 seconds). NameNode can be configured to use this staleness information for reads using configuration "dfs.namenode.avoid.read.stale.datanode". When this parameter is set to true, namenode picks a stale datanode as the last target to read from when returning block locations for reads. Using staleness information for writes is as described in the releases notes of HDFS-3912.

If the cluster configs are set to limit the default permissions (e.g.: fs.permissions.umask-mode=0077 instead of the default 0022), then the cache directories are created with too-restrictive permissions and no jobs are able to run.</blockquote></li>

     Major improvement reported by Todd Lipcon and fixed by Arun C Murthy (capacityscheduler)<br>
     <b>Support delay scheduling for node locality in MR2's capacity scheduler</b><br>
     <blockquote>The capacity scheduler in MR2 doesn't support delay scheduling for achieving node-level locality. So, jobs exhibit poor data locality even if they have good rack locality. Especially on clusters where disk throughput is much better than network capacity, this hurts overall job performance. We should optionally support node-level delay scheduling heuristics similar to what the fair scheduler implements in MR1.</blockquote></li>

     Major bug reported by Siddharth Seth and fixed by Siddharth Seth <br>
     <b>RMContainer should handle a RELEASE event while RUNNING</b><br>
     <blockquote>An AppMaster can send a container release at any point. Currently this results in an exception, if this is done while the RM considers the container to be RUNNING.
The event not being processed correctly also implies that these containers do not show up in the Completed Container List seen by the AM (AMRMProtocol). MR-3902 depends on this set being complete. </blockquote></li>

     Major bug reported by patrick white and fixed by Daryn Sharp (nodemanager)<br>
     <b>NodeManager will refuse to shutdown indefinitely due to container log aggregation</b><br>
     <blockquote>The nodemanager is able to get into a state where containermanager.logaggregation.AppLogAggregatorImpl will apparently wait
indefinitely for log aggregation to complete for an application, even if that application has abnormally terminated and is no longer present. 

Observed behavior is that an attempt to stop the nodemanager daemon will return but have no effect, the nm log continually displays messages similar to this:

[Thread-1]2012-08-21 17:44:07,581 INFO
org.apache.hadoop.yarn.server.nodemanager.containermanager.logaggregation.AppLogAggregatorImpl:
Waiting for aggregation to complete for application_1345221477405_2733

The only recovery we found to work was to 'kill -9' the nm process.

What exactly causes the NM to enter this state is unclear but we do see this behavior reliably when the NM has run a task which failed, for example when debugging oozie distcp actions and having a distcp map task fail, the NM that was running the container will now enter this state where a shutdown on said NM will never complete, 'never' in this case was waiting for 2 hours before killing the nodemanager process.

     <b>aggregated logs permissions not set properly</b><br>
     <blockquote>If the default file permissions are set to something restrictive - like 700, application logs get aggregated and created with those restrictive file permissions which doesn't allow the history server to serve them up.


They need to be created with group readable similar to how log aggregation sets up the directory permissions.

3. However, after defining the capacity of "newQueue" followed by a second "bin/mapred queue -refreshQueues" throws "org.apache.hadoop.metrics2.MetricsException: Metrics source QueueMetrics,q0=root,q1=newQueue already exists!"

2. ( yarn.scheduler.capacity.minimum-allocation-mb and yarn.scheduler.capacity.maximum-allocation-mb )

In favor of two new, generically named properties:

1. yarn.scheduler.minimum-allocation-mb - This acts as the floor value of memory resource requests for containers.
2. yarn.scheduler.maximum-allocation-mb - This acts as the ceiling value of memory resource requests for containers.

Both these properties need to be set at the ResourceManager (RM) to take effect, as the RM is where the scheduler resides.

Also changes the default minimum and maximums to 128 MB and 10 GB respectively.</blockquote></li>

a. dfs.block.local-path-access.user is the key in datanode configuration to specify the user allowed to do short circuit read.
b. dfs.client.read.shortcircuit is the key to enable short circuit read at the client side configuration.
c. dfs.client.read.shortcircuit.skip.checksum is the key to bypass checksum check at the client side.
2. By default none of the above are enabled and short circuit read will not kick in.
3. If security is on, the feature can be used only for user that has kerberos credentials at the client, therefore map reduce tasks cannot benefit from it in general.

     <b>MRv2 WebApp Security</b><br>
     <blockquote>A new server has been added to yarn.  It is a web proxy that sits in front of the AM web UI.  The server is controlled by the yarn.web-proxy.address config.  If that config is set, and it points to an address that is different then the RM web interface then a separate proxy server needs to be launched.

This can be done by running 

yarn-daemon.sh start proxyserver

If a separate proxy server is needed other configs also may need to be set, if security is enabled.
yarn.web-proxy.principal
yarn.web-proxy.keytab

The proxy server is stateless and should be able to support a VIP or other load balancing sitting in front of multiple instances of this server.</blockquote></li>

This would be taken at intervals that depend on the task progress plateaus. For example, reducers have three progress ranges - [0-1/3], (1/3-2/3], and (2/3-3/3] - where fundamentally different activities happen. Mappers have different boundaries that are not symmetrically placed [0-9/10], (9/10-1]. Data capture boundaries should coincide with activity boundaries.

     <b>Map-Reduce 2.0</b><br>
     <blockquote>MapReduce has undergone a complete re-haul in hadoop-0.23 and we now have, what we call, MapReduce 2.0 (MRv2).

The fundamental idea of MRv2 is to split up the two major functionalities of the JobTracker, resource management and job scheduling/monitoring, into separate daemons. The idea is to have a global ResourceManager (RM) and per-application ApplicationMaster (AM).  An application is either a single job in the classical sense of Map-Reduce jobs or a DAG of jobs. The ResourceManager and per-node slave, the NodeManager (NM), form the data-computation framework. The ResourceManager is the ultimate authority that arbitrates resources among all the applications in the system. The per-application ApplicationMaster is, in effect, a framework specific library and is tasked with negotiating resources from the ResourceManager and working with the NodeManager(s) to execute and monitor the tasks.

The ResourceManager has two main components:
* Scheduler (S)
* ApplicationsManager (ASM)

The Scheduler is responsible for allocating resources to the various running applications subject to familiar constraints of capacities, queues etc. The Scheduler is pure scheduler in the sense that it performs no monitoring or tracking of status for the application. Also, it offers no guarantees on restarting failed tasks either due to application failure or hardware failures. The Scheduler performs its scheduling function based the resource requirements of the applications; it does so based on the abstract notion of a Resource Container which incorporates elements such as memory, cpu, disk, network etc. 

The Scheduler has a pluggable policy plug-in, which is responsible for partitioning the cluster resources among the various queues, applications etc. The current Map-Reduce schedulers such as the CapacityScheduler and the FairScheduler would be some examples of the plug-in.

The CapacityScheduler supports hierarchical queues to allow for more predictable sharing of cluster resources.
The ApplicationsManager is responsible for accepting job-submissions, negotiating the first container for executing the application specific ApplicationMaster and provides the service for restarting the ApplicationMaster container on failure.

The NodeManager is the per-machine framework agent who is responsible for launching the applications' containers, monitoring their resource usage (cpu, memory, disk, network) and reporting the same to the Scheduler.

The per-application ApplicationMaster has the responsibility of negotiating appropriate resource containers from the Scheduler, tracking their status and monitoring for progress.
