<h2>Changes since Hadoop 0.23.5</h2>
<ul>
<li> <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YARN-325">YARN-325</a>.
     Blocker bug reported by Jason Lowe and fixed by Arun C Murthy (capacityscheduler)<br>
     <b>RM CapacityScheduler can deadlock when getQueueInfo() is called and a container is completing</b><br>
     <blockquote>If a client calls getQueueInfo on a parent queue (e.g.: the root queue) and containers are completing then the RM can deadlock.  getQueueInfo() locks the ParentQueue and then calls the child queues' getQueueInfo() methods in turn.  However when a container completes, it locks the LeafQueue then calls back into the ParentQueue.  When the two mix, it's a recipe for deadlock.

Stacktrace to follow.</blockquote></li>
<li> <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YARN-320">YARN-320</a>.
     Blocker bug reported by Daryn Sharp and fixed by Daryn Sharp (resourcemanager)<br>
     <b>RM should always be able to renew its own tokens</b><br>
     <blockquote>YARN-280 introduced fast-fail for job submissions with bad tokens.  Unfortunately, other stack components like oozie and customers are acquiring RM tokens with a hardcoded dummy renewer value.  These jobs would fail after 24 hours because the RM token couldn't be renewed, but fast-fail is failing them immediately.  The RM should always be able to renew its own tokens submitted with a job.  The renewer field may continue to specify an external user who can renew.</blockquote></li>
<li> <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YARN-293">YARN-293</a>.
     Critical bug reported by Devaraj K and fixed by Robert Joseph Evans (nodemanager)<br>
     <b>Node Manager leaks LocalizerRunner object for every Container </b><br>
     <blockquote>Node Manager creates a new LocalizerRunner object for every container and puts in ResourceLocalizationService.LocalizerTracker.privLocalizers map but it never removes from the map.</blockquote></li>
<li> <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YARN-285">YARN-285</a>.
     Major improvement reported by Derek Dagit and fixed by Derek Dagit <br>
     <b>RM should be able to provide a tracking link for apps that have already been purged</b><br>
     <blockquote>As applications complete, the RM tracks their IDs in a completed list.  This list is routinely truncated to limit the total number of application remembered by the RM.

When a user clicks the History for a job, either the browser is redirected to the application's tracking link obtained from the stored application instance.  But when the application has been purged from the RM, an error is displayed.

In very busy clusters the rate at which applications complete can cause applications to be purged from the RM's internal list within hours, which breaks the proxy URLs users have saved for their jobs.

We would like the RM to provide valid tracking links persist so that users are not frustrated by broken links.</blockquote></li>

     Major sub-task reported by Daryn Sharp and fixed by Daryn Sharp (resourcemanager)<br>
     <b>RM does not reject app submission with invalid tokens</b><br>
     <blockquote>The RM will launch an app with invalid tokens.  The tasks will languish with failed connection retries, followed by task reattempts, followed by app reattempts.</blockquote></li>
<li> <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YARN-266">YARN-266</a>.
     Critical bug reported by Ravi Prakash and fixed by Ravi Prakash (resourcemanager)<br>
     <b>RM and JHS Web UIs are blank because AppsBlock is not escaping string properly</b><br>
     <blockquote>e.g. Job names with a line feed "\n" are causing a line feed in the JSON array being written out (since we are only using StringEscapeUtils.escapeHtml() ) and the Javascript parser complains that string quotes are unclosed. This </blockquote></li>

     Major bug reported by Ravi Prakash and fixed by Ravi Prakash (resourcemanager)<br>
     <b>RM web page UI shows Invalid Date for start and finish times</b><br>
     <blockquote>Whenever the number of jobs was greater than a 100, two javascript arrays were being populated. appsData and appsTableData. appsData was winning out (because it was coming out later) and so renderHadoopDate was trying to render a &lt;br title=""...&gt; string.
</blockquote></li>
<li> <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YARN-251">YARN-251</a>.
     Major bug reported by Tom White and fixed by Tom White (resourcemanager)<br>
     <b>Proxy URI generation fails for blank tracking URIs</b><br>
     <blockquote>If the URI is an empty string (the default if not set), then a warning is displayed. A null URI displays no such warning. These two cases should be handled in the same way.</blockquote></li>
<li> <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YARN-225">YARN-225</a>.

     <blockquote>Problem is that on every update of processTree new object is required. This is undesired when working with processTree implementation in native code.

     Major bug reported by Sandy Ryza and fixed by Sandy Ryza (nodemanager)<br>
     <b>NodeManager stop() gets called twice on shutdown</b><br>
     <blockquote>The stop method in the NodeManager gets called twice when the NodeManager is shut down via the shutdown hook.

The first is the stop that gets called directly by the shutdown hook.  The second occurs when the NodeStatusUpdaterImpl is stopped.  The NodeManager responds to the NodeStatusUpdaterImpl stop stateChanged event by stopping itself.  This is so that NodeStatusUpdaterImpl can notify the NodeManager to stop, by stopping itself in response to a request from the ResourceManager

This could be avoided if the NodeStatusUpdaterImpl were to stop the NodeManager by calling its stop method directly.</blockquote></li>
<li> <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YARN-80">YARN-80</a>.
     Major improvement reported by Todd Lipcon and fixed by Arun C Murthy (capacityscheduler)<br>
     <b>Support delay scheduling for node locality in MR2's capacity scheduler</b><br>
     <blockquote>The capacity scheduler in MR2 doesn't support delay scheduling for achieving node-level locality. So, jobs exhibit poor data locality even if they have good rack locality. Especially on clusters where disk throughput is much better than network capacity, this hurts overall job performance. We should optionally support node-level delay scheduling heuristics similar to what the fair scheduler implements in MR1.</blockquote></li>

     Major bug reported by Hitesh Shah and fixed by Sandy Ryza (nodemanager)<br>
     <b>NM should handle cleaning up containers when it shuts down</b><br>
     <blockquote>Ideally, the NM should wait for a limited amount of time when it gets a shutdown signal for existing containers to complete and kill the containers ( if we pick an aggressive approach ) after this time interval. 

For NMs which come up after an unclean shutdown, the NM should look through its directories for existing container.pids and try and kill an existing containers matching the pids found. </blockquote></li>
