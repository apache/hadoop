## This is where you can redefine the layout of Hadoop directories
## and expect to be reasonably compatible.  Needless to say, this
## is expert level stuff and one needs to tread carefully.
##
## If you move HADOOP_LIBEXEC_DIR from some location that
## isn't bin/../libexec, you MUST define either HADOOP_LIBEXEC_DIR
## or have HADOOP_PREFIX/libexec/hadoop-config.sh and
## HADOOP_PREFIX/libexec/hadoop-layout.sh (this file) exist.

## NOTE:
##
## hadoop-functions.sh gets executed BEFORE this file.  So you can
##   redefine all of those functions here.
##
## *-env.sh get executed AFTER this file but generally too late to
## override the settings (but not the functions!) here.  However, this
## also means you cannot use things like HADOOP_CONF_DIR for these
## definitions.
