Hadoop Alfredo, Java HTTP SPNEGO ${project.version}

  Hadoop Alfredo is a Java library consisting of a client and a server
  components to enable Kerberos SPNEGO authentication for HTTP.

  Alfredo also supports additional authentication mechanisms on the client
  and the server side via 2 simple interfaces.

  License 2.0}}.

* How Does Alfredo Works?

  Alfredo enforces authentication on protected resources, once authentiation
  has been established it sets a signed HTTP Cookie that contains an
  authentication token with the user name, user principal, authentication type
  and expiration time.

  Subsequent HTTP client requests presenting the signed HTTP Cookie have access
  to the protected resources until the HTTP Cookie expires.
