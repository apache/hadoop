<!-- This is the template for queue configuration. The format supports nesting of
     queues within queues - a feature called hierarchical queues. All queues are
     defined within the 'queues' tag which is the top level element for this
     XML document.
     The 'aclsEnabled' attribute should be set to true, if ACLs should be checked
     on queue operations such as submitting jobs, killing jobs etc. -->

  <!-- Here is a sample of a hierarchical queue configuration

       queue as it has no queues configured within it. Currently, ACLs
       and state are only supported for the leaf level queues.
