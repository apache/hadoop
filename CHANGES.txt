               Jim Kellerman)
   HADOOP-2786 Move hbase out of hadoop core
   HBASE-403   Fix build after move of hbase in svn

  NEW FEATURES

  OPTIMIZATIONS

  BUG FIXES
   HADOOP-2731 Under load, regions become extremely large and eventually cause
               region servers to become unresponsive
   HADOOP-2693 NPE in getClosestRowBefore (Bryan Duxbury & Stack)

               (Bryan Duxbury & Stack)

               server death

Release 0.16.0

  2008/02/04   HBase is now a subproject of Hadoop. The first HBase release as
               a subproject will be release 0.1.0 which will be equivalent to
               the version of HBase included in Hadoop 0.16.0. In order to
               accomplish this, the HBase portion of HBASE-288 (formerly 
               HADOOP-1398) has been backed out. Once 0.1.0 is frozen (depending
               mostly on changes to infrastructure due to becoming a sub project
               instead of a contrib project), this patch will re-appear on HBase
               trunk.

   HADOOP-2407 Keeping MapFile.Reader open is expensive: Part 2
   HADOOP-2533 Performance: Scanning, just creating MapWritable in next
               consumes >20% CPU
   HADOOP-2443 Keep lazy cache of regions in client rather than an
               'authoritative' list (Bryan Duxbury via Stack)

               startKey as key for map.put. Change TestRegionServerExit to
               always kill the region server for the META region. This makes
               the test more deterministic and getting META reassigned was
               problematic.
