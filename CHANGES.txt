Release 0.16.0

  2008/02/04   HBase is now a subproject of Hadoop. The first HBase release as
               a subproject will be release 0.1.0 which will be equivalent to
               the version of HBase included in Hadoop 0.16.0. In order to
               accomplish this, the HBase portion of HBASE-288 (formerly 
               HADOOP-1398) has been backed out. Once 0.1.0 is frozen (depending
               mostly on changes to infrastructure due to becoming a sub project
               instead of a contrib project), this patch will re-appear on HBase
               trunk.

               the test more deterministic and getting META reassigned was
