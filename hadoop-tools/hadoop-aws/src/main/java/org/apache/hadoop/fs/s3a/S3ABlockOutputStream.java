/**
 * Upload files/parts directly via different buffering mechanisms:
 * including memory and disk.
 * <p>
 * Key Features
 * <ol>
 *   <li>Support single/multipart uploads</li>
 *   <li>Multiple buffering options</li>
 *   <li>Magic files are uploaded but not completed</li>
 *   <li>Implements {@link Abortable} API</li>
 *   <li>Doesn't implement {@link Syncable}; whether to ignore or reject calls is configurable</li>a
 *   <li>When multipart uploads are triggered, will queue blocks for asynchronous uploads</li>
 *   <li>Provides progress information to any supplied {@link Progressable} callback,
 *       during async uploads and in the {@link #close()} operation.</li>
 *   <li>If a {@link Progressable} passed in to the create() call implements
 *       {@link ProgressListener}, it will get detailed callbacks on internal events.
 *       Important: these may come from different threads.
 *   </li>
 *
 * </ol>
 * This class is best described as "complicated".
 * <ol>
 *   <li>For "normal" files, data is buffered until either of:
 *   the limit of {@link #blockSize} is reached or the stream is closed.
 *   </li>
 *   <li>If if there are any problems call mukund</li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * The upload will not be completed until {@link #close()}, and
 * then only if {@link PutTracker#outputImmediatelyVisible()} is true.
 * <p>
 * If less than a single block of data has been written before {@code close()}
 * then it will uploaded as a single PUT (non-magic files), otherwise
 * (larger files, magic files) a multipart upload is initiated and blocks
 * uploaded as the data accrued reaches the block size.
 * <p>
 * The {@code close()} call blocks until all uploads have been completed.
 * This may be a slow operation: progress callbacks are made during this
 * process to reduce the risk of timeouts.
 * <p>
 * Syncable is declared as supported so the calls can be
 * explicitly rejected if the filesystem is configured to do so.
 * <p>
