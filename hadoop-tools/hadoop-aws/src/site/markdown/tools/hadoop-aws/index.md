## <a name="overview"></a> Overview

Apache Hadoop's `hadoop-aws` module provides support for AWS integration,
primarily the s3a open source connector to Amazon S3 Storage, including
Amazon S3 Express One zone storage as well as third-party stores with S3
compatibility.

## <a name="installation"></a> Installation

### <a name="SDK download"></a> SDK Download

This release uses the AWS SDK for Java 2.0

Unless using a hadoop release with the AWS SDK `bundle.jar` JAR included
in the binary distribution, the library MUST be downloaded and installed
into the hadoop distribution.

The exact version of the SDK to be used is listed in the file:
```
LICENSE-binary
```
The [mvn repository](https://mvnrepository.com/)
site will list it as a "Compile Dependency" of the
[hadoop-aws](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.apache.hadoop/hadoop-aws) artifact.

AWS SDK releases can be downloaded from github at [AWS SDK for Java 2.0](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-java-v2)

Or from the [Maven central repository](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/software/amazon/awssdk/bundle/).

Download the release and place it in the directory `share/hadoop/tools/lib`
of the hadoop distribution.

* Using an earlier SDK than that this SDK was compiled and tested against
  will not work.
* Using a later SDK *should* work, but there are no guarantees.
* The V1 SDK will not work.

Any project declaring a dependency on `hadoop-aws` in their Maven/Ivy/SBT/Gradle
build will automatically get the specific version of the AWS SDK which this
module was compiled against.

### <a name="inclusion-on-classpath"></a> Inclusion on classpath

To include the S3A client in Apache Hadoop's default classpath:

1. Make sure that`HADOOP_OPTIONAL_TOOLS` in `hadoop-env.sh` includes `hadoop-aws`
in its list of optional modules to add in the classpath.

1. For client side interaction, you can declare that relevant JARs must be loaded
in your `~/.hadooprc` file:

        hadoop_add_to_classpath_tools hadoop-aws

The settings in this file does not propagate to deployed applications, but it will
work for local clients such as the `hadoop fs` command.


## <a name="introduction"></a> Introducing the Hadoop S3A client.

Hadoop's "S3A" client offers high-performance IO against Amazon S3 object store
and compatible implementations.

* Directly reads and writes S3 objects.
* Compatible with standard S3 clients.
* Compatible with files created by the older `s3n://` client and Amazon EMR's `s3://` client.
* Supports partitioned uploads for many-GB objects.
* Offers a high-performance random IO mode for working with columnar data such
as Apache ORC and Apache Parquet files.
* Uses Amazon's Java V2 SDK with support for latest S3 features and authentication
schemes.
* Supports authentication via: environment variables, Hadoop configuration
properties, the Hadoop key management store and IAM roles.
* Supports per-bucket configuration.
* Supports S3 "Server Side Encryption" for both reading and writing:
 SSE-S3, SSE-KMS and SSE-C.
* Supports S3-CSE client side encryption.
* Instrumented with Hadoop metrics.
* Actively maintained by the open source community.


### Other S3 Connectors

There other Hadoop connectors to S3. Only S3A is actively maintained by
the Hadoop project itself.

1. Amazon EMR's `s3://` client. This is from the Amazon EMR team, who actively
maintain it.



## <a name="getting_started"></a> Getting Started

S3A depends upon two JARs, alongside `hadoop-common` and its dependencies.

* `hadoop-aws` JAR. This contains the S3A connector.
* `bundle` JAR. This contains the full shaded AWS V2 SDK.

The versions of `hadoop-common` and `hadoop-aws` must be identical.

To import the libraries into a Maven build, add `hadoop-aws` JAR to the
build dependencies; it will pull in a compatible aws-sdk JAR.

The `hadoop-aws` JAR *does not* declare any dependencies other than that
dependencies unique to it, the AWS SDK JAR. This is simplify excluding/tuning
Hadoop dependency JARs in downstream applications. The `hadoop-client` or
`hadoop-common` dependency must be declared


```xml
<properties>
 <!-- Your exact Hadoop version here-->
  <hadoop.version>3.0.0</hadoop.version>
</properties>

<dependencies>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.hadoop</groupId>
    <artifactId>hadoop-client</artifactId>
    <version>${hadoop.version}</version>
  </dependency>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.hadoop</groupId>
    <artifactId>hadoop-aws</artifactId>
    <version>${hadoop.version}</version>
  </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

## <a name="warning"></a> Warnings

Amazon S3 is an example of "an object store". In order to achieve scalability
and especially high availability, S3 has —as many other cloud object stores have
done— relaxed some of the constraints which classic "POSIX" filesystems promise.

For further discussion on these topics, please consult
[The Hadoop FileSystem API Definition](../../../hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-common/filesystem/index.html).


### Warning #1: Directories are mimicked

The S3A clients mimics directories by:

1. Creating a stub entry after a `mkdirs` call, deleting it when a file
is added anywhere underneath
1. When listing a directory, searching for all objects whose path starts with
the directory path, and returning them as the listing.
1. When renaming a directory, taking such a listing and asking S3 to copying the
individual objects to new objects with the destination filenames.
1. When deleting a directory, taking such a listing and deleting the entries in
batches.
1. When renaming or deleting directories, taking such a listing and working
on the individual files.


Here are some of the consequences:

* Directories may lack modification times.
Parts of Hadoop relying on this can have unexpected behaviour. E.g. the
`AggregatedLogDeletionService` of YARN will not remove the appropriate logfiles.
* Directory listing can be slow. Use `listFiles(path, recursive)` for high
performance recursive listings whenever possible.
* It is possible to create files under files if the caller tries hard.
* The time to rename a directory is proportional to the number of files
underneath it (directory or indirectly) and the size of the files. (The copy is
executed inside the S3 storage, so the time is independent of the bandwidth
from client to S3).
* Directory renames are not atomic: they can fail partway through, and callers
cannot safely rely on atomic renames as part of a commit algorithm.
* Directory deletion is not atomic and can fail partway through.

The final three issues surface when using S3 as the immediate destination
of work, as opposed to HDFS or other "real" filesystem.

The [S3A committers](./committers.html) are the sole mechanism available
to safely save the output of queries directly into S3 object stores
through the S3A filesystem when the filesystem structure is
how the table is represented.


### Warning #2: Object stores have different authorization models

The object authorization model of S3 is much different from the file
authorization model of HDFS and traditional file systems.
The S3A client simply reports stub information from APIs that would query this metadata:

* File owner is reported as the current user.
* File group also is reported as the current user.
* Directory permissions are reported as 777.
* File permissions are reported as 666.

S3A does not really enforce any authorization checks on these stub permissions.
Users authenticate to an S3 bucket using AWS credentials.  It's possible that
object ACLs have been defined to enforce authorization at the S3 side, but this
happens entirely within the S3 service, not within the S3A implementation.

### Warning #4: Your AWS credentials are very, very valuable

Your AWS credentials not only pay for services, they offer read and write
access to the data. Anyone with the credentials can not only read your datasets
—they can delete them.

Do not inadvertently share these credentials through means such as:

1. Checking in to SCM any configuration files containing the secrets.
1. Logging them to a console, as they invariably end up being seen.
1. Including the secrets in bug reports.
1. Logging the `AWS_` environment variables.

If you do any of these: change your credentials immediately!


## Connecting to Amazon S3 or a third-party store

See [Connecting to an Amazon S3 Bucket through the S3A Connector](connecting.html).

Also, please check [S3 endpoint and region settings in detail](connecting.html#s3_endpoint_region_details).

## <a name="authenticating"></a> Authenticating with S3

See [Authenticating with S3](authentication.md).

## <a name="hadoop_credential_providers"></a>Storing secrets with Hadoop Credential Providers

The Hadoop Credential Provider Framework allows secure "Credential Providers"
to keep secrets outside Hadoop configuration files, storing them in encrypted
files in local or Hadoop filesystems, and including them in requests.

The S3A configuration options with sensitive data
(`fs.s3a.secret.key`, `fs.s3a.access.key`,  `fs.s3a.session.token`
and `fs.s3a.encryption.key`) can
have their data saved to a binary file stored, with the values being read in
when the S3A filesystem URL is used for data access. The reference to this
credential provider then declared in the Hadoop configuration.

For additional reading on the Hadoop Credential Provider API see:
[Credential Provider API](../../../hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-common/CredentialProviderAPI.html).


The following configuration options can be stored in Hadoop Credential Provider
stores.

```
fs.s3a.access.key
fs.s3a.secret.key
fs.s3a.session.token
fs.s3a.encryption.key
fs.s3a.encryption.algorithm
```

The first three are for authentication; the final two for
[encryption](./encryption.html). Of the latter, only the encryption key can
be considered "sensitive". However, being able to include the algorithm in
the credentials allows for a JCECKS file to contain all the options needed
to encrypt new data written to S3.

### Step 1: Create a credential file

A credential file can be created on any Hadoop filesystem; when creating one on HDFS or
a Unix filesystem the permissions are automatically set to keep the file
private to the reader —though as directory permissions are not touched,
users should verify that the directory containing the file is readable only by
the current user.

```bash
hadoop credential create fs.s3a.access.key -value 123 \
    -provider jceks://hdfs@nn1.example.com:9001/user/backup/s3.jceks

hadoop credential create fs.s3a.secret.key -value 456 \
    -provider jceks://hdfs@nn1.example.com:9001/user/backup/s3.jceks
```

A credential file can be listed, to see what entries are kept inside it

```bash
hadoop credential list -provider jceks://hdfs@nn1.example.com:9001/user/backup/s3.jceks

Listing aliases for CredentialProvider: jceks://hdfs@nn1.example.com:9001/user/backup/s3.jceks
fs.s3a.secret.key
fs.s3a.access.key
```
At this point, the credentials are ready for use.

### Step 2: Configure the `hadoop.security.credential.provider.path` property

The URL to the provider must be set in the configuration property
`hadoop.security.credential.provider.path`, either on the command line or
in XML configuration files.

```xml
<property>
  <name>hadoop.security.credential.provider.path</name>
  <value>jceks://hdfs@nn1.example.com:9001/user/backup/s3.jceks</value>
  <description>Path to interrogate for protected credentials.</description>
</property>
```

Because this property only supplies the path to the secrets file, the configuration
option itself is no longer a sensitive item.

The property `hadoop.security.credential.provider.path` is global to all
filesystems and secrets.
There is another property, `fs.s3a.security.credential.provider.path`
which only lists credential providers for S3A filesystems.
The two properties are combined into one, with the list of providers in the
`fs.s3a.` property taking precedence
over that of the `hadoop.security` list (i.e. they are prepended to the common list).

```xml
<property>
  <name>fs.s3a.security.credential.provider.path</name>
  <value />
  <description>
    Optional comma separated list of credential providers, a list
    which is prepended to that set in hadoop.security.credential.provider.path
  </description>
</property>
```

This was added to support binding different credential providers on a per
bucket basis, without adding alternative secrets in the credential list.
However, some applications (e.g Hive) prevent the list of credential providers
from being dynamically updated by users. As per-bucket secrets are now supported,
it is better to include per-bucket keys in JCEKS files and other sources
of credentials.

### Using secrets from credential providers

Once the provider is set in the Hadoop configuration, Hadoop commands
work exactly as if the secrets were in an XML file.

```bash
hadoop distcp \
    hdfs://nn1.example.com:9001/user/backup/007020615 s3a://glacier1/

hadoop fs -ls s3a://glacier1/
```

The path to the provider can also be set on the command line:

```bash
hadoop distcp \
    -D hadoop.security.credential.provider.path=jceks://hdfs@nn1.example.com:9001/user/backup/s3.jceks \
    hdfs://nn1.example.com:9001/user/backup/007020615 s3a://glacier1/

hadoop fs \
  -D fs.s3a.security.credential.provider.path=jceks://hdfs@nn1.example.com:9001/user/backup/s3.jceks \
  -ls s3a://glacier1/
```

Because the provider path is not itself a sensitive secret, there is no risk
from placing its declaration on the command line.


## <a name="general_configuration"></a>General S3A Client configuration

All S3A client options are configured with options with the prefix `fs.s3a.`.

The client supports <a href="per_bucket_configuration">Per-bucket configuration</a>
to allow different buckets to override the shared settings. This is commonly
used to change the endpoint, encryption and authentication mechanisms of buckets.
and various minor options.

Here are some the S3A properties for use in production.

* See [Performance](./performance.html) for performance related settings including
  thread and network pool options.
* Testing-related options are covered in [Testing](./testing.md).

## <a name="retry_and_recovery"></a>Retry and Recovery

The S3A client makes a best-effort attempt at recovering from network failures;
this section covers the details of what it does.

The S3A divides exceptions returned by the AWS SDK into different categories,
and chooses a different retry policy based on their type and whether or
not the failing operation is idempotent.


### Unrecoverable Problems: Fail Fast

* No object/bucket store: `FileNotFoundException`
* No access permissions: `AccessDeniedException`
* Network errors considered unrecoverable (`UnknownHostException`,
 `NoRouteToHostException`, `AWSRedirectException`).
* Interruptions: `InterruptedIOException`, `InterruptedException`.
* Rejected HTTP requests: `InvalidRequestException`

These and others are all considered unrecoverable: S3A will make no attempt to recover
from them. The AWS SDK itself may retry before the S3A connector sees the exception.
As an example, the SDK will retry on `UnknownHostException` in case it is a transient
DNS error.

### Possibly Recoverable Problems: Retry

* Connection timeout: `ConnectTimeoutException`. Timeout before
setting up a connection to the S3 endpoint (or proxy).
* HTTP response status code 400, "Bad Request"

The status code 400, Bad Request usually means that the request
is unrecoverable; it's the generic "No" response. Very rarely it
does recover, which is why it is in this category, rather than that
of unrecoverable failures.

These failures will be retried with an exponential sleep interval set in
`fs.s3a.retry.interval`, up to the limit set in `fs.s3a.retry.limit`.


### Only retriable on idempotent operations

Some network failures are considered to be retriable if they occur on
idempotent operations; there's no way to know if they happened
after the request was processed by S3.

* `SocketTimeoutException`: general network failure.
* `EOFException` : the connection was broken while reading data
* "No response from Server" (443, 444) HTTP responses.
* Any other AWS client, service or S3 exception.

These failures will be retried with an exponential sleep interval set in
`fs.s3a.retry.interval`, up to the limit set in `fs.s3a.retry.limit`.

*Important*: DELETE is considered idempotent, hence: `FileSystem.delete()`
and `FileSystem.rename()` will retry their delete requests on any
of these failures.

The issue of whether delete should be idempotent has been a source
of historical controversy in Hadoop.

1. In the absence of any other changes to the object store, a repeated
DELETE request will eventually result in the named object being deleted;
it's a no-op if reprocessed. As indeed, is `Filesystem.delete()`.
1. If another client creates a file under the path, it will be deleted.
1. Any filesystem supporting an atomic `FileSystem.create(path, overwrite=false)`
operation to reject file creation if the path exists MUST NOT consider
delete to be idempotent, because a `create(path, false)` operation will
only succeed if the first `delete()` call has already succeeded.
1. And a second, retried `delete()` call could delete the new data.

Because S3 is eventually consistent *and* doesn't support an
atomic create-no-overwrite operation, the choice is more ambiguous.

S3A considers delete to be idempotent because it is convenient for many workflows,
including the commit protocols. Just be aware that in the presence of transient failures,
more things may be deleted than expected.

### Throttled requests from S3


When AWS S3 returns a response indicating that requests
from the caller are being throttled, an exponential back-off with
an initial interval and a maximum number of requests.

```xml
<property>
  <name>fs.s3a.retry.throttle.limit</name>
  <value>${fs.s3a.attempts.maximum}</value>
  <description>
    Number of times to retry any throttled request.
  </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>fs.s3a.retry.throttle.interval</name>
  <value>1000ms</value>
  <description>
    Interval between retry attempts on throttled requests.
  </description>
</property>
```

Notes

1. There is also throttling taking place inside the AWS SDK; this is managed
by the value `fs.s3a.attempts.maximum`.
1. Throttling events are tracked in the S3A filesystem metrics and statistics.
1. Amazon KMS may throttle a customer based on the total rate of uses of
KMS *across all user accounts and applications*.

Throttling of S3 requests is all too common; it is caused by too many clients
trying to access the same shard of S3 Storage. This generally
happen if there are too many reads, those being the most common in Hadoop
applications. This problem is exacerbated by Hive's partitioning
strategy used when storing data, such as partitioning by year and then month.
This results in paths with little or no variation at their start, which ends
up in all the data being stored in the same shard(s).

Here are some expensive operations; the more of these taking place
against part of an S3 bucket, the more load it experiences.
* Many clients trying to list directories or calling `getFileStatus` on
paths (LIST and HEAD requests respectively)
* The GET requests issued when reading data.
* Random IO used when reading columnar data (ORC, Parquet) means that many
more GET requests than a simple one-per-file read.
* The number of active writes to that part of the S3 bucket.

A special case is when enough data has been written into part of an S3 bucket
that S3 decides to split the data across more than one shard: this
is believed to be one by some copy operation which can take some time.
While this is under way, S3 clients access data under these paths will
be throttled more than usual.


Mitigation strategies

1. Use separate buckets for intermediate data/different applications/roles.
1. Use significantly different paths for different datasets in the same bucket.
1. Increase the value of `fs.s3a.retry.throttle.interval` to provide
longer delays between attempts.
1. Reduce the parallelism of the queries. The more tasks trying to access
data in parallel, the more load.
1. Reduce `fs.s3a.threads.max` to reduce the amount of parallel operations
performed by clients.
!. Maybe: increase `fs.s3a.readahead.range` to increase the minimum amount
of data asked for in every GET request, as well as how much data is
skipped in the existing stream before aborting it and creating a new stream.
1. KMS: "consult AWS about increasing your capacity".



## Handling Read-During-Overwrite

Read-during-overwrite is the condition where a writer overwrites a file while
a reader has an open input stream on the file.  Depending on configuration,
the S3AFileSystem may detect this and throw a `RemoteFileChangedException` in
conditions where the reader's input stream might otherwise silently switch over
from reading bytes from the original version of the file to reading bytes from
the new version.

The configurations items controlling this behavior are:

```xml
<property>
  <name>fs.s3a.change.detection.source</name>
  <value>etag</value>
  <description>
    Select which S3 object attribute to use for change detection.
    Currently support 'etag' for S3 object eTags and 'versionid' for
    S3 object version IDs.  Use of version IDs requires object versioning to be
    enabled for each S3 bucket utilized.  Object versioning is disabled on
    buckets by default. When version ID is used, the buckets utilized should
    have versioning enabled before any data is written.
  </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>fs.s3a.change.detection.mode</name>
  <value>server</value>
  <description>
    Determines how change detection is applied to alert to S3 objects
    rewritten while being read. Value 'server' indicates to apply the attribute
    constraint directly on GetObject requests to S3. Value 'client' means to do a
    client-side comparison of the attribute value returned in the response.  Value
    'server' would not work with third-party S3 implementations that do not
    support these constraints on GetObject. Values 'server' and 'client' generate
    RemoteObjectChangedException when a mismatch is detected.  Value 'warn' works
    like 'client' but generates only a warning.  Value 'none' will ignore change
    detection completely.
  </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>fs.s3a.change.detection.version.required</name>
  <value>true</value>
  <description>
    Determines if S3 object version attribute defined by
    fs.s3.change.detection.source should be treated as required.  If true and the
    referred attribute is unavailable in an S3 GetObject response,
    NoVersionAttributeException is thrown.  Setting to 'true' is encouraged to
    avoid potential for inconsistent reads with third-party S3 implementations or
    against S3 buckets that have object versioning disabled.
  </description>
</property>
```

In the default configuration, S3 object eTags are used to detect changes.  When
the filesystem retrieves a file from S3 using
[Get Object](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/RESTObjectGET.html),
it captures the eTag and uses that eTag in an `If-Match` condition on each
subsequent request.  If a concurrent writer has overwritten the file, the
'If-Match' condition will fail and a `RemoteFileChangedException` will be thrown.

Even in this default configuration, a new write may not trigger this exception
on an open reader.  For example, if the reader only reads forward in the file
then only a single S3 'Get Object' request is made and the full contents of the
file are streamed from a single response.  An overwrite of the file after the
'Get Object' request would not be seen at all by a reader with an input stream
that had already read the first byte.  Seeks backward on the other hand can
result in new 'Get Object' requests that can trigger the
`RemoteFileChangedException`.

### Change detection with S3 Versions.

It is possible to switch to using the
[S3 object version id](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ObjectVersioning.html)
instead of eTag as the change detection mechanism.  Use of this option requires
object versioning to be enabled on any S3 buckets used by the filesystem.  The
benefit of using version id instead of eTag is potentially reduced frequency
of `RemoteFileChangedException`. With object versioning enabled, old versions
of objects remain available after they have been overwritten.
This means an open input stream will still be able to seek backwards after a
concurrent writer has overwritten the file.
The reader will retain their consistent view of the version of the file from
which they read the first byte.
Because the version ID is null for objects written prior to enablement of
object versioning, **this option should only be used when the S3 buckets
have object versioning enabled from the beginning.**

Note: when you rename files the copied files may have a different version number.

### Change Detection Modes.

Configurable change detection mode is the next option.  Different modes are
available primarily for compatibility with third-party S3 implementations which
may not support all change detection mechanisms.

* `server`: the version/etag check is performed on the server by adding
extra headers to the `GET` request. This is the default.
* `client` : check on the client by comparing the eTag/version ID of a
reopened file with the previous version.
This is useful when the implementation doesn't support the `If-Match` header.
* `warn`: check on the client, but only warn on a mismatch, rather than fail.
* `none` do not check. Useful if the implementation doesn't provide eTag
or version ID support at all or you would like to retain previous behavior
where the reader's input stream silently switches over to the new object version
(not recommended).

The final option (`fs.s3a.change.detection.version.required`) is present
primarily to ensure the filesystem doesn't silently ignore the condition
where it is configured to use version ID on a bucket that doesn't have
object versioning enabled or alternatively it is configured to use eTag on
an S3 implementation that doesn't return eTags.

When `true` (default) and 'Get Object' doesn't return eTag or
version ID (depending on configured 'source'), a `NoVersionAttributeException`
will be thrown.  When `false` and eTag or version ID is not returned,
the stream can be read, but without any version checking.


## <a name="per_bucket_configuration"></a>Configuring different S3 buckets with Per-Bucket Configuration

Different S3 buckets can be accessed with different S3A client configurations.
This allows for different endpoints, data read and write strategies, as well
as login details.

1. All `fs.s3a` options other than a small set of unmodifiable values
 (currently `fs.s3a.impl`) can be set on a per bucket basis.
1. The bucket specific option is set by replacing the `fs.s3a.` prefix on an option
with `fs.s3a.bucket.BUCKETNAME.`, where `BUCKETNAME` is the name of the bucket.
1. When connecting to a bucket, all options explicitly set will override
the base `fs.s3a.` values.

As an example, a configuration could have a base configuration to use the IAM
role information available when deployed in Amazon EC2.

```xml
<property>
  <name>fs.s3a.aws.credentials.provider</name>
  <value>org.apache.hadoop.fs.s3a.auth.IAMInstanceCredentialsProvider</value>
</property>
```

This will become the default authentication mechanism for S3A buckets.

A bucket `s3a://nightly/` used for nightly data can then be given
a session key:

```xml
<property>
  <name>fs.s3a.bucket.nightly.access.key</name>
  <value>AKAACCESSKEY-2</value>
</property>

<property>
  <name>fs.s3a.bucket.nightly.secret.key</name>
  <value>SESSIONSECRETKEY</value>
</property>

<property>
  <name>fs.s3a.bucket.nightly.session.token</name>
  <value>Short-lived-session-token</value>
</property>

<property>
  <name>fs.s3a.bucket.nightly.aws.credentials.provider</name>
  <value>org.apache.hadoop.fs.s3a.TemporaryAWSCredentialsProvider</value>
</property>
```

Finally, the public `s3a://noaa-isd-pds/` bucket can be accessed anonymously:

```xml
<property>
  <name>fs.s3a.bucket.noaa-isd-pds.aws.credentials.provider</name>
  <value>org.apache.hadoop.fs.s3a.AnonymousAWSCredentialsProvider</value>
</property>
```

#### per-bucket configuration and deprecated configuration options

Per-bucket declaration of the deprecated encryption options
will take priority over a global option -even when the
global option uses the newer configuration keys.

This means that when setting encryption options in XML files,
the option, `fs.bucket.BUCKET.fs.s3a.server-side-encryption-algorithm`
will take priority over the global value of `fs.bucket.s3a.encryption.algorithm`.
The same holds for the encryption key option `fs.s3a.encryption.key`
and its predecessor `fs.s3a.server-side-encryption.key`.


For a site configuration of:

```xml
<property>
  <name>fs.s3a.bucket.nightly.server-side-encryption-algorithm</name>
  <value>SSE-KMS</value>
</property>

<property>
  <name>fs.s3a.bucket.nightly.server-side-encryption.key</name>
  <value>arn:aws:kms:eu-west-2:1528130000000:key/753778e4-2d0f-42e6-b894-6a3ae4ea4e5f</value>
</property>

<property>
  <name>fs.s3a.encryption.algorithm</name>
  <value>AES256</value>
</property>

<property>
  <name>fs.s3a.encryption.key</name>
  <value>unset</value>
</property>

<property>
  <name>fs.s3a.encryption.context</name>
  <value>unset</value>
</property>


```

The bucket "nightly" will be encrypted with SSE-KMS using the KMS key
`arn:aws:kms:eu-west-2:1528130000000:key/753778e4-2d0f-42e6-b894-6a3ae4ea4e5f`

## <a name="requester_pays"></a>Requester Pays buckets

S3A supports buckets with
[Requester Pays](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/RequesterPaysBuckets.html)
enabled. When a bucket is configured with requester pays, the requester must cover
the per-request cost.

For requests to be successful, the S3 client must acknowledge that they will pay
for these requests by setting a request flag, usually a header, on each request.

To enable this feature within S3A, configure the `fs.s3a.requester.pays.enabled` property.

```xml
<property>
    <name>fs.s3a.requester.pays.enabled</name>
    <value>true</value>
</property>
```

## <a name="storage_classes"></a>Storage Classes

Amazon S3 offers a range of [Storage Classes](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/)
that you can choose from based on behavior of your applications. By using the right
storage class, you can reduce the cost of your bucket.

S3A uses Standard storage class for PUT object requests by default, which is suitable for
general use cases. To use a specific storage class, set the value in `fs.s3a.create.storage.class` property to
the storage class you want.

```xml
<property>
    <name>fs.s3a.create.storage.class</name>
    <value>intelligent_tiering</value>
</property>
```

Please note that S3A does not support reading from archive storage classes at the moment.
`AccessDeniedException` with `InvalidObjectState` will be thrown if you're trying to do so.

When a file is "renamed" through the s3a connector it is copied then deleted.
Storage Classes will normally be propagated.


## <a name="outposts"></a>Configuring S3A for S3 on Outposts

S3A now supports [S3 on Outposts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/S3onOutposts.html).
Accessing data through an access point is done by using its Amazon Resource Name (ARN), as opposed to just the bucket name.
The only supported storage class on Outposts is `OUTPOSTS`, and by default objects are encrypted with [SSE-S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-outposts-data-encryption.html).
You can set the Access Point ARN property using the following per bucket configuration property:

```xml
<property>
  <name>fs.s3a.bucket.sample-outpost-bucket.accesspoint.arn</name>
  <value>arn:aws:s3-outposts:region:account-id:outpost/outpost-id/accesspoint/accesspoint-name</value>
  <description>Configure S3a traffic to use this S3 on Outposts Access Point ARN</description>
</property>
```

This configures access to the `sample-outpost-bucket` for S3A to go through the new Access Point ARN. So, for example `s3a://sample-outpost-bucket/key` will now use your configured ARN when getting data from S3 on Outpost instead of your bucket.


## <a name="upload"></a>How S3A writes data to S3

The original S3A client implemented file writes by
buffering all data to disk as it was written to the `OutputStream`.
Only when the stream's `close()` method was called would the upload start.

This made output slow, especially on large uploads, and could even
fill up the disk space of small (virtual) disks.

Hadoop 2.7 added the `S3AFastOutputStream` alternative, which Hadoop 2.8 expanded.
It is now considered stable and has replaced the original `S3AOutputStream`,
which is no longer shipped in hadoop.

The "fast" output stream

1.  Uploads large files as blocks with the size set by
    `fs.s3a.multipart.size`. That is: the threshold at which multipart uploads
    begin and the size of each upload are identical. This behavior can be enabled
    or disabled by using the flag `fs.s3a.multipart.uploads.enabled` which by
    default is set to true.
1.  Buffers blocks to disk (default) or in on-heap or off-heap memory.
1.  Uploads blocks in parallel in background threads.
1.  Begins uploading blocks as soon as the buffered data exceeds this partition
    size.
1.  When buffering data to disk, uses the directory/directories listed in
    `fs.s3a.buffer.dir`. The size of data which can be buffered is limited
    to the available disk space.
1.  Generates output statistics as metrics on the filesystem, including
    statistics of active and pending block uploads.
1.  Has the time to `close()` set by the amount of remaining data to upload, rather
    than the total size of the file.

Because it starts uploading while data is still being written, it offers
significant benefits when very large amounts of data are generated.
The in memory buffering mechanisms may also offer speedup when running adjacent to
S3 endpoints, as disks are not used for intermediate data storage.

  <description>
    The buffering mechanism to use.
    Values: disk, array, bytebuffer.

    "disk" will use the directories listed in fs.s3a.buffer.dir as
    the location(s) to save data prior to being uploaded.

    "array" uses arrays in the JVM heap

    "bytebuffer" uses off-heap memory within the JVM.

    Both "array" and "bytebuffer" will consume memory in a single stream up to the number
    of blocks set by:

        fs.s3a.multipart.size * fs.s3a.fast.upload.active.blocks.

    If using either of these mechanisms, keep this value low

    The total number of threads performing work across all threads is set by
    fs.s3a.threads.max, with fs.s3a.max.total.tasks values setting the number of queued
    work items.

**Notes**

* If the amount of data written to a stream is below that set in `fs.s3a.multipart.size`,
the upload is performed in the `OutputStream.close()` operation —as with
the original output stream.

* The published Hadoop metrics monitor include live queue length and
upload operation counts, so identifying when there is a backlog of work/
a mismatch between data generation rates and network bandwidth. Per-stream
statistics can also be logged by calling `toString()` on the current stream.

* Files being written are still invisible until the write
completes in the `close()` call, which will block until the upload is completed.


### <a name="upload_disk"></a>Buffering upload data on disk `fs.s3a.fast.upload.buffer=disk`

When `fs.s3a.fast.upload.buffer` is set to `disk`, all data is buffered
to local hard disks prior to upload. This minimizes the amount of memory
consumed, and so eliminates heap size as the limiting factor in queued uploads
—exactly as the original "direct to disk" buffering.


```xml
<property>
  <name>fs.s3a.fast.upload.buffer</name>
  <value>disk</value>
</property>

<property>
  <name>fs.s3a.buffer.dir</name>
  <value>${env.LOCAL_DIRS:-${hadoop.tmp.dir}}/s3a</value>
  <description>Comma separated list of directories that will be used to buffer file
    uploads to.
    Yarn container path will be used as default value on yarn applications,
    otherwise fall back to hadoop.tmp.dir
  </description>
</property>
```

This is the default buffer mechanism. The amount of data which can
be buffered is limited by the amount of available disk space.

### <a name="upload_bytebuffer"></a>Buffering upload data in ByteBuffers: `fs.s3a.fast.upload.buffer=bytebuffer`

When `fs.s3a.fast.upload.buffer` is set to `bytebuffer`, all data is buffered
in "Direct" ByteBuffers prior to upload. This *may* be faster than buffering to disk,
and, if disk space is small (for example, tiny EC2 VMs), there may not
be much disk space to buffer with.

The ByteBuffers are created in the memory of the JVM, but not in the Java Heap itself.
The amount of data which can be buffered is
limited by the Java runtime, the operating system, and, for YARN applications,
the amount of memory requested for each container.

The slower the upload bandwidth to S3, the greater the risk of running out
of memory —and so the more care is needed in
[tuning the upload settings](#upload_thread_tuning).


```xml
<property>
  <name>fs.s3a.fast.upload.buffer</name>
  <value>bytebuffer</value>
</property>
```

### <a name="upload_array"></a>Buffering upload data in byte arrays: `fs.s3a.fast.upload.buffer=array`

When `fs.s3a.fast.upload.buffer` is set to `array`, all data is buffered
in byte arrays in the JVM's heap prior to upload.
This *may* be faster than buffering to disk.

The amount of data which can be buffered is limited by the available
size of the JVM heap. The slower the write bandwidth to S3, the greater
the risk of heap overflows. This risk can be mitigated by
[tuning the upload settings](#upload_thread_tuning).

```xml
<property>
  <name>fs.s3a.fast.upload.buffer</name>
  <value>array</value>
</property>
```

### <a name="upload_thread_tuning"></a>Upload Thread Tuning

Both the [Array](#upload_array) and [Byte buffer](#upload_bytebuffer)
buffer mechanisms can consume very large amounts of memory, on-heap or
off-heap respectively. The [disk buffer](#upload_disk) mechanism
does not use much memory up, but will consume hard disk capacity.

If there are many output streams being written to in a single process, the
amount of memory or disk used is the multiple of all stream's active memory/disk use.

Careful tuning may be needed to reduce the risk of running out memory, especially
if the data is buffered in memory.

There are a number parameters which can be tuned:

1. The total number of threads available in the filesystem for data
uploads *or any other queued filesystem operation*. This is set in
`fs.s3a.threads.max`

1. The number of operations which can be queued for execution:, *awaiting
a thread*: `fs.s3a.max.total.tasks`

1. The number of blocks which a single output stream can have active,
that is: being uploaded by a thread, or queued in the filesystem thread queue:
`fs.s3a.fast.upload.active.blocks`

1. How long an idle thread can stay in the thread pool before it is retired: `fs.s3a.threads.keepalivetime`


When the maximum allowed number of active blocks of a single stream is reached,
no more blocks can be uploaded from that stream until one or more of those active
blocks' uploads completes. That is: a `write()` call which would trigger an upload
of a now full datablock, will instead block until there is capacity in the queue.

How does that come together?

* As the pool of threads set in `fs.s3a.threads.max` is shared (and intended
to be used across all threads), a larger number here can allow for more
parallel operations. However, as uploads require network bandwidth, adding more
threads does not guarantee speedup.

* The extra queue of tasks for the thread pool (`fs.s3a.max.total.tasks`)
covers all ongoing background S3A operations (future plans include: parallelized
rename operations, asynchronous directory operations).

* When using memory buffering, a small value of `fs.s3a.fast.upload.active.blocks`
limits the amount of memory which can be consumed per stream.

* When using disk buffering a larger value of `fs.s3a.fast.upload.active.blocks`
does not consume much memory. But it may result in a large number of blocks to
compete with other filesystem operations.


We recommend a low value of `fs.s3a.fast.upload.active.blocks`; enough
to start background upload without overloading other parts of the system,
then experiment to see if higher values deliver more throughput —especially
from VMs running on EC2.

```xml

<property>
  <name>fs.s3a.fast.upload.active.blocks</name>
  <value>4</value>
  <description>
    Maximum Number of blocks a single output stream can have
    active (uploading, or queued to the central FileSystem
    instance's pool of queued operations.

    This stops a single stream overloading the shared thread pool.

### <a name="multipart_purge"></a>Cleaning up after partial Upload Failures

There are four mechanisms for cleaning up after leftover multipart
uploads:
- AWS Lifecycle rules. This is the simplest and SHOULD be used unless there
  are are good reasons, such as the store not supporting lifecycle rules.
- Hadoop s3guard CLI commands for listing and deleting uploads by their
age. Documented in the [S3Guard](./s3guard.html) section.
- Setting `fs.s3a.directory.operations.purge.uploads` to `true` for automatic
  scan and delete during directory rename and delete
- The configuration parameter `fs.s3a.multipart.purge`, covered below.

If a large stream write operation is interrupted, there may be
intermediate partitions uploaded to S3 —data which will be billed for.
If an S3A committer job is halted partway through, again, there may be
many incomplete multipart uploads in the output directory.

These charges can be reduced by enabling `fs.s3a.multipart.purge`,
and setting a purge time in seconds, such as 24 hours.
When an S3A FileSystem instance is instantiated with the purge time greater
than zero, it will, on startup, delete all outstanding partition requests
older than this time. However, this makes filesystem instantiate slow, especially
against very large buckets, as a full scan is made.

Consider avoiding this in future.

```xml
<property>
  <name>fs.s3a.multipart.purge</name>
  <value>true</value>
  <description>True if you want to purge existing multipart uploads that may not have been
     completed/aborted correctly</description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>fs.s3a.multipart.purge.age</name>
  <value>24h</value>
  <description>Minimum age in seconds of multipart uploads to purge</description>
</property>
```

If an S3A client is instantiated with `fs.s3a.multipart.purge=true`,
it will delete all out of date uploads *in the entire bucket*. That is: it will affect all
multipart uploads to that bucket, from all applications.

Leaving `fs.s3a.multipart.purge` to its default, `false`,
means that the client will not make any attempt to reset or change the partition
rate.

The best practise for using this option is to disable multipart purges in
normal use of S3A, enabling only in manual/scheduled housekeeping operations.

### S3A "fadvise" input policy support

The S3A Filesystem client supports the notion of input policies, similar
to that of the Posix `fadvise()` API call. This tunes the behavior of the S3A
client to optimise HTTP GET requests for the different use cases.

See [Improving data input performance through fadvise](./performance.html#fadvise)
for the details.

##<a name="metrics"></a>Metrics

S3A metrics can be monitored through Hadoop's metrics2 framework. S3A creates
its own metrics system called s3a-file-system, and each instance of the client
will create its own metrics source, named with a JVM-unique numerical ID.

As a simple example, the following can be added to `hadoop-metrics2.properties`
to write all S3A metrics to a log file every 10 seconds:

    s3a-file-system.sink.my-metrics-config.class=org.apache.hadoop.metrics2.sink.FileSink
    s3a-file-system.sink.my-metrics-config.filename=/var/log/hadoop-yarn/s3a-metrics.out
    *.period=10

Lines in that file will be structured like the following:

    1511208770680 s3aFileSystem.s3aFileSystem: Context=s3aFileSystem, s3aFileSystemId=892b02bb-7b30-4ffe-80ca-3a9935e1d96e, bucket=bucket,
    Hostname=hostname-1.hadoop.apache.com, files_created=1, files_copied=2, files_copied_bytes=10000, files_deleted=5, fake_directories_deleted=3,
    directories_created=3, directories_deleted=0, ignored_errors=0, op_copy_from_local_file=0, op_exists=0, op_get_file_status=15, op_glob_status=0,
    op_is_directory=0, op_is_file=0, op_list_files=0, op_list_located_status=0, op_list_status=3, op_mkdirs=1, op_rename=2, object_copy_requests=0,
    object_delete_requests=6, object_list_requests=23, object_continue_list_requests=0, object_metadata_requests=46, object_multipart_aborted=0,
    object_put_bytes=0, object_put_requests=4, object_put_requests_completed=4, stream_write_failures=0, stream_write_block_uploads=0,
    stream_write_block_uploads_committed=0, stream_write_block_uploads_aborted=0, stream_write_total_time=0, stream_write_total_data=0,
    s3guard_metadatastore_put_path_request=10, s3guard_metadatastore_initialization=0, object_put_requests_active=0, object_put_bytes_pending=0,
    stream_write_block_uploads_active=0, stream_write_block_uploads_pending=0, stream_write_block_uploads_data_pending=0,
    S3guard_metadatastore_put_path_latencyNumOps=0, S3guard_metadatastore_put_path_latency50thPercentileLatency=0,
    S3guard_metadatastore_put_path_latency75thPercentileLatency=0, S3guard_metadatastore_put_path_latency90thPercentileLatency=0,
    S3guard_metadatastore_put_path_latency95thPercentileLatency=0, S3guard_metadatastore_put_path_latency99thPercentileLatency=0

Depending on other configuration, metrics from other systems, contexts, etc. may
also get recorded, for example the following:

    1511208770680 metricssystem.MetricsSystem: Context=metricssystem, Hostname=s3a-metrics-4.gce.cloudera.com, NumActiveSources=1, NumAllSources=1,
    NumActiveSinks=1, NumAllSinks=0, Sink_fileNumOps=2, Sink_fileAvgTime=1.0, Sink_fileDropped=0, Sink_fileQsize=0, SnapshotNumOps=5,
    SnapshotAvgTime=0.0, PublishNumOps=2, PublishAvgTime=0.0, DroppedPubAll=0

Note that low-level metrics from the AWS SDK itself are not currently included
in these metrics.

### <a name="distcp"></a> Copying Data with distcp

Hadoop's `distcp` tool is often used to copy data between a Hadoop
cluster and Amazon S3.
See [Copying Data Between a Cluster and Amazon S3](https://hortonworks.github.io/hdp-aws/s3-copy-data/index.html)
for details on S3 copying specifically.

The `distcp update` command tries to do incremental updates of data.
It is straightforward to verify when files do not match when they are of
different length, but not when they are the same size.

Distcp addresses this by comparing file checksums on the source and destination
filesystems, which it tries to do *even if the filesystems have incompatible
checksum algorithms*.

The S3A connector can provide the HTTP etag header to the caller as the
checksum of the uploaded file. Doing so will break distcp operations
between hdfs and s3a.

For this reason, the etag-as-checksum feature is disabled by default.

```xml
<property>
  <name>fs.s3a.etag.checksum.enabled</name>
  <value>false</value>
  <description>
    Should calls to getFileChecksum() return the etag value of the remote
    object.
    WARNING: if enabled, distcp operations between HDFS and S3 will fail unless
    -skipcrccheck is set.
  </description>
</property>
```

If enabled, `distcp` between two S3 buckets can use the checksum to compare
objects. Their checksums should be identical if they were either each uploaded
as a single file PUT, or, if in a multipart PUT, in blocks of the same size,
as configured by the value `fs.s3a.multipart.size`.

To disable checksum verification in `distcp`, use the `-skipcrccheck` option:

```bash
hadoop distcp -update -skipcrccheck -numListstatusThreads 40 /user/alice/datasets s3a://alice-backup/datasets
```

### <a name="customsigners"></a> Advanced - Custom Signers

AWS uees request signing to authenticate requests. In general, there should
be no need to override the signers, and the defaults work out of the box.
If, however, this is required - this section talks about how to configure
custom signers. There’s 2 broad config categories to be set - one for
registering a custom signer and another to specify usage.

#### Registering Custom Signers
```xml
<property>
  <name>fs.s3a.custom.signers</name>
  <value>comma separated list of signers</value>
  <!-- Example
  <value>AWS4SignerType,CS1:CS1ClassName,CS2:CS2ClassName:CS2InitClass</value>
  -->
</property>
```
Acceptable value for each custom signer

`SignerName`- this is used in case one of the default signers is being used.
(E.g `AWS4SignerType`, `QueryStringSignerType`, `AWSS3V4SignerType`).
If no custom signers are being used - this value does not need to be set.

`SignerName:SignerClassName` - register a new signer with the specified name,
and the class for this signer.
The Signer Class must implement `software.amazon.awssdk.core.signer.Signer`.

`SignerName:SignerClassName:SignerInitializerClassName` - similar time above
except also allows for a custom SignerInitializer
(`org.apache.hadoop.fs.s3a.AwsSignerInitializer`) class to be specified.

#### Usage of the Signers
Signers can be set at a per-service level (S3, etc) or a common
signer for all services.

```xml
<property>
  <name>fs.s3a.s3.signing-algorithm</name>
  <value>${S3SignerName}</value>
  <description>Specify the signer for S3</description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>fs.s3a.signing-algorithm</name>
  <value>${SignerName}</value>
</property>
```

For a specific service, the service specific signer is looked up first.
If that is not specified, the common signer is looked up. If this is
not specified as well, SDK settings are used.
