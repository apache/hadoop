# S3A Prefetching

This document explains the `S3PrefetchingInputStream` and the various components it uses.

This input stream implements prefetching and caching to improve read performance of the input
stream.
A high level overview of this feature was published in
[Pinterest Engineering's blog post titled "Improving efficiency and reducing runtime using S3 read optimization"](https://medium.com/pinterest-engineering/improving-efficiency-and-reducing-runtime-using-s3-read-optimization-b31da4b60fa0).

With prefetching, the input stream divides the remote file into blocks of a fixed size, associates
buffers to these blocks and then reads data into these buffers asynchronously.
It also potentially caches these blocks.

### Basic Concepts

* **Remote File**: A binary blob of data stored on some storage device.
* **Block File**: Local file containing a block of the remote file.
* **Block**: A file is divided into a number of blocks.
The size of the first n-1 blocks is same, and the size of the last block may be same or smaller.
* **Block based reading**: The granularity of read is one block.
That is, either an entire block is read and returned or none at all.
Multiple blocks may be read in parallel.

### Configuring the stream

| Property                      | Meaning                          | Default |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------------|---------|
| `fs.s3a.prefetch.enabled`     | Enable the prefetch input stream | `false` |
| `fs.s3a.prefetch.block.size`  | Size of a block                  | `8M`    |
| `fs.s3a.prefetch.block.count` | Number of blocks to prefetch     | `8`     |

The default size of a block is 8MB, and the minimum allowed block size is 1 byte.
Decreasing block size will increase the number of blocks to be read for a file.
A smaller block size may negatively impact performance as the number of prefetches required will increase.

### Key Components

`S3PrefetchingInputStream` - When prefetching is enabled, S3AFileSystem will return an instance of
this class as the input stream.
Depending on the remote file size, it will either use
the `S3InMemoryInputStream` or the `S3CachingInputStream` as the underlying input stream.

`S3InMemoryInputStream` - Underlying input stream used when the remote file size < configured block
size.
Will read the entire remote file into memory.

`S3CachingInputStream` - Underlying input stream used when remote file size > configured block size.
Uses asynchronous prefetching of blocks and caching to improve performance.

`BlockData` - Holds information about the blocks in a remote file, such as:

* Number of blocks in the remote file
* Block size
* State of each block (initially all blocks have state *NOT_READY*).
Other states are: Queued, Ready, Cached.

`BufferData` - Holds the buffer and additional information about it such as:

* The block number this buffer is for
* State of the buffer (Unknown, Blank, Prefetching, Caching, Ready, Done).
Initial state of a buffer is blank.

`CachingBlockManager` - Implements reading data into the buffer, prefetching and caching.

`BufferPool` - Manages a fixed sized pool of buffers.
It's used by `CachingBlockManager` to acquire buffers.

`S3File` - Implements operations to interact with S3 such as opening and closing the input stream to
the remote file in S3.

`S3Reader` - Implements reading from the stream opened by `S3File`.
Reads from this input stream in blocks of 64KB.

`FilePosition` - Provides functionality related to tracking the position in the file.
Also gives access to the current buffer in use.

`SingleFilePerBlockCache` - Responsible for caching blocks to the local file system.
Each cache block is stored on the local disk as a separate block file.

### Operation

#### S3InMemoryInputStream

For a remote file with size 5MB, and block size = 8MB, since file size is less than the block size,
the `S3InMemoryInputStream` will be used.

If the caller makes the following read calls:

```java
in.read(buffer, 0, 3MB);
in.read(buffer, 0, 2MB);
```

When the first read is issued, there is no buffer in use yet.
The `S3InMemoryInputStream` gets the data in this remote file by calling the `ensureCurrentBuffer()`
method, which ensures that a buffer with data is available to be read from.

The `ensureCurrentBuffer()` then:

* Reads data into a buffer by calling `S3Reader.read(ByteBuffer buffer, long offset, int size)`.
* `S3Reader` uses `S3File` to open an input stream to the remote file in S3 by making
  a `getObject()` request with range as `(0, filesize)`.
* The `S3Reader` reads the entire remote file into the provided buffer, and once reading is complete
  closes the S3 stream and frees all underlying resources.
* Now the entire remote file is in a buffer, set this data in `FilePosition` so it can be accessed
  by the input stream.

The read operation now just gets the required bytes from the buffer in `FilePosition`.

When the second read is issued, there is already a valid buffer which can be used.
Don't do anything else, just read the required bytes from this buffer.

#### S3CachingInputStream

If there is a remote file with size 40MB and block size = 8MB, the `S3CachingInputStream` will be
used.

##### Sequential Reads

If the caller makes the following calls:

```
in.read(buffer, 0, 5MB)
in.read(buffer, 0, 8MB)
```

For the first read call, there is no valid buffer yet.
`ensureCurrentBuffer()` is called, and for the first `read()`, prefetch count is set as 1.

The current block (block 0) is read synchronously, while the blocks to be prefetched (block 1) is
read asynchronously.

The `CachingBlockManager` is responsible for getting buffers from the buffer pool and reading data
into them. This process of acquiring the buffer pool works as follows:

* The buffer pool keeps a map of allocated buffers and a pool of available buffers.
The size of this pool is = prefetch block count + 1.
If the prefetch block count is 8, the buffer pool has a size of 9.
* If the pool is not yet at capacity, create a new buffer and add it to the pool.
* If it's at capacity, check if any buffers with state = done can be released.
Releasing a buffer means removing it from allocated and returning it back to the pool of available
buffers.
* If there are no buffers with state = done currently then nothing will be released, so retry the
  above step at a fixed interval a few times till a buffer becomes available.
* If after multiple retries there are still no available buffers, release a buffer in the ready state.
The buffer for the block furthest from the current block is released.

Once a buffer has been acquired by `CachingBlockManager`, if the buffer is in a *READY* state, it is
returned.
This means that data was already read into this buffer asynchronously by a prefetch.
If its state is *BLANK* then data is read into it using
`S3Reader.read(ByteBuffer buffer, long offset, int size).`

For the second read call, `in.read(buffer, 0, 8MB)`, since the block sizes are of 8MB and only 5MB
of block 0 has been read so far, 3MB of the required data will be read from the current block 0.
Once all data has been read from this block, `S3CachingInputStream` requests the next block (
block 1), which will already have been prefetched and so it can just start reading from it.
Also, while reading from block 1 it will also issue prefetch requests for the next blocks.
The number of blocks to be prefetched is determined by `fs.s3a.prefetch.block.count`.

##### Random Reads

The `CachingInputStream` also caches prefetched blocks. This happens when `read()` is issued
after a `seek()` outside the current block, but the current block still has not been fully read.

For example, consider the following calls:

```
in.read(buffer, 0, 5MB)
in.seek(10MB)
in.read(buffer, 0, 4MB)
in.seek(2MB)
in.read(buffer, 0, 4MB)
```

For the above read sequence, after the `seek(10MB)` call is issued, block 0 has not been read
completely so the subsequent call to `read()` will cache it, on the assumption that the caller
will probably want to read from it again.

After `seek(2MB)` is called, the position is back inside block 0. The next read can now be
satisfied from the locally cached block file, which is typically orders of magnitude faster
than a network based read.

NB: `seek()` is implemented lazily, so it only keeps track of the new position but does not
otherwise affect the internal state of the stream. Only when a `read()` is issued, it will call
the `ensureCurrentBuffer()` method and fetch a new block if required.
