Overview
--------

  DistCp (distributed copy) is a tool used for large
  inter/intra-cluster copying. It uses MapReduce to effect its distribution,
  error handling and recovery, and reporting. It expands a list of files and
  directories into input to map tasks, each of which will copy a partition of
  the files specified in the source list.

  [The erstwhile implementation of DistCp]
  (http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r1.2.1/distcp.html) has its share of quirks
  and drawbacks, both in its usage and its extensibility and
  performance. The purpose of the DistCp refactor was to fix these
  shortcomings, enabling it to be used and extended programmatically. New
  paradigms have been introduced to improve runtime and setup performance,
  while simultaneously retaining the legacy behaviour as default.

  This document aims to describe the design of the new DistCp, its spanking new
  features, their optimal use, and any deviance from the legacy implementation.

Usage
-----

$H3 Basic Usage

  The most common invocation of DistCp is an inter-cluster copy:

    bash$ hadoop distcp hdfs://nn1:8020/foo/bar \
    hdfs://nn2:8020/bar/foo

  This will expand the namespace under `/foo/bar` on nn1 into a temporary file,
  partition its contents among a set of map tasks, and start a copy on each
  NodeManager from `nn1` to `nn2`.

  One can also specify multiple source directories on the command line:

    bash$ hadoop distcp hdfs://nn1:8020/foo/a \
    hdfs://nn1:8020/foo/b \
    hdfs://nn2:8020/bar/foo

  Or, equivalently, from a file using the -f option:

    bash$ hadoop distcp -f hdfs://nn1:8020/srclist \
    hdfs://nn2:8020/bar/foo

  Where `srclist` contains

    hdfs://nn1:8020/foo/a
    hdfs://nn1:8020/foo/b

  When copying from multiple sources, DistCp will abort the copy with an error
  message if two sources collide, but collisions at the destination are
  resolved per the [options](#Command_Line_Options) specified. By default,
  files already existing at the destination are skipped (i.e. not replaced by
  the source file). A count of skipped files is reported at the end of each
  job, but it may be inaccurate if a copier failed for some subset of its
  files, but succeeded on a later attempt.

  It is important that each NodeManager can reach and communicate with both the
  source and destination file systems. For HDFS, both the source and
  destination must be running the same version of the protocol or use a
  backwards-compatible protocol; see [Copying Between Versions]
  (#Copying_Between_Versions_of_HDFS).

  After a copy, it is recommended that one generates and cross-checks a listing
  of the source and destination to verify that the copy was truly successful.
  Since DistCp employs both Map/Reduce and the FileSystem API, issues in or
  between any of the three could adversely and silently affect the copy. Some
  have had success running with `-update` enabled to perform a second pass, but
  users should be acquainted with its semantics before attempting this.

  It's also worth noting that if another client is still writing to a source
  file, the copy will likely fail. Attempting to overwrite a file being written
  at the destination should also fail on HDFS. If a source file is (re)moved
  before it is copied, the copy will fail with a `FileNotFoundException`.

  Please refer to the detailed Command Line Reference for information on all
  the options available in DistCp.

$H3 Update and Overwrite

  `-update` is used to copy files from source that don't exist at the target
  or differ from the target version. `-overwrite` overwrites target-files that
  exist at the target.

  The Update and Overwrite options warrant special attention since their
  handling of source-paths varies from the defaults in a very subtle manner.
  Consider a copy from `/source/first/` and `/source/second/` to `/target/`,
  where the source paths have the following contents:

    hdfs://nn1:8020/source/first/1
    hdfs://nn1:8020/source/first/2
    hdfs://nn1:8020/source/second/10
    hdfs://nn1:8020/source/second/20

  When DistCp is invoked without `-update` or `-overwrite`, the DistCp defaults
  would create directories `first/` and `second/`, under `/target`. Thus:

    distcp hdfs://nn1:8020/source/first hdfs://nn1:8020/source/second hdfs://nn2:8020/target

  would yield the following contents in `/target`:

    hdfs://nn2:8020/target/first/1
    hdfs://nn2:8020/target/first/2
    hdfs://nn2:8020/target/second/10
    hdfs://nn2:8020/target/second/20

  When either `-update` or `-overwrite` is specified, the **contents** of the
  source-directories are copied to target, and not the source directories
  themselves. Thus:

    distcp -update hdfs://nn1:8020/source/first hdfs://nn1:8020/source/second hdfs://nn2:8020/target

  would yield the following contents in `/target`:

    hdfs://nn2:8020/target/1
    hdfs://nn2:8020/target/2
    hdfs://nn2:8020/target/10
    hdfs://nn2:8020/target/20

  By extension, if both source folders contained a file with the same name
  (say, `0`), then both sources would map an entry to `/target/0` at the
  destination. Rather than to permit this conflict, DistCp will abort.

  Now, consider the following copy operation:

    distcp hdfs://nn1:8020/source/first hdfs://nn1:8020/source/second hdfs://nn2:8020/target

  With sources/sizes:

    hdfs://nn1:8020/source/first/1 32
    hdfs://nn1:8020/source/first/2 32
    hdfs://nn1:8020/source/second/10 64
    hdfs://nn1:8020/source/second/20 32

  And destination/sizes:

    hdfs://nn2:8020/target/1 32
    hdfs://nn2:8020/target/10 32
    hdfs://nn2:8020/target/20 64

  The result will be:

    hdfs://nn2:8020/target/1 32
    hdfs://nn2:8020/target/2 32
    hdfs://nn2:8020/target/10 64
    hdfs://nn2:8020/target/20 32

  `1` is skipped because the file-length and contents match. `2` is copied
  because it doesn't exist at the target. `10` and `20` are overwritten since
  the contents don't match the source.

  If `-update` is used, `1` is skipped because the file-length and contents match. `2` is copied because it doesn't exist at the target. `10` and `20` are overwritten since the contents donâ€™t match the source. However, if `-append` is additionally used, then only `10` is overwritten (source length less than destination) and `20` is appended with the change in file (if the files match up to the destination's original length).

  If `-overwrite` is used, `1` is overwritten as well.

$H3 Sync

  `-diff` option syncs files from a source cluster to a target cluster with a
  snapshot diff. It copies, renames and removes files in the snapshot diff list.

  `-update` option must be included when `-diff` option is in use.

  Most cloud providers don't work well with sync at the moment.

  Usage:

    hadoop distcp -update -diff <from_snapshot> <to_snapshot> <source> <destination>

  Example:

    hadoop distcp -update -diff snap1 snap2 /src/ /dst/

  The command above applies changes from snapshot `snap1` to `snap2`
  (i.e. snapshot diff from `snap1` to `snap2`) in `/src/` to `/dst/`.
  Obviously, it requires `/src/` to have both snapshots `snap1` and `snap2`.
  But the destination  `/dst/` must also have a snapshot with the same
  name as `<from_snapshot>`, in this case `snap1`. The destination `/dst/`
  should not have new file operations (create, rename, delete) since `snap1`.
  Note that when this command finishes, a new snapshot `snap2` will NOT be
  created at `/dst/`.

  `-update` is required to use `-diff` option.

  For instance, in `/src/`, if `1.txt` is added and `2.txt` is deleted after
  the creation of `snap1` and before creation of `snap2`, the command above
  will copy `1.txt` from `/src/` to `/dst/` and delete `2.txt` from `/dst/`.

  Sync behavior will be elaborated using experiments below.

$H4 Experiment 1: Syncing diff of two adjacent snapshots

  Some preparations before we start.

    # Create source and destination directories
    hdfs dfs -mkdir /src/ /dst/
    # Allow snapshot on source
    hdfs dfsadmin -allowSnapshot /src/
    # Create a snapshot (empty one)
    hdfs dfs -createSnapshot /src/ snap1
    # Allow snapshot on destination
    hdfs dfsadmin -allowSnapshot /dst/
    # Create a from_snapshot with the same name
    hdfs dfs -createSnapshot /dst/ snap1

    # Put one text file under /src/
    echo "This is the 1st text file." > 1.txt
    hdfs dfs -put 1.txt /src/
    # Create the second snapshot
    hdfs dfs -createSnapshot /src/ snap2

    # Put another text file under /src/
    echo "This is the 2nd text file." > 2.txt
    hdfs dfs -put 2.txt /src/
    # Create the third snapshot
    hdfs dfs -createSnapshot /src/ snap3

  Then we run distcp sync:

    hadoop distcp -update -diff snap1 snap2 /src/ /dst/

  The command above should succeed. `1.txt` will be copied from `/src/` to
  `/dst/`. Again, `-update` option is required.

  If we run the same command again, we will get `DistCp sync failed` exception
  because the destination has added a new file `1.txt` since `snap1`. That
  being said, if we remove `1.txt` manually from `/dst/` and run the sync, the
  command will succeed.

$H4 Experiment 2: syncing diff of two non-adjacent snapshots

  First do a cleanup from Experiment 1.

    hdfs dfs -rm -skipTrash /dst/1.txt

  Run sync command, note the `<to_snapshot>` has been changed from `snap2` in
  Experiment 1 to `snap3`.

    hadoop distcp -update -diff snap1 snap3 /src/ /dst/

  Both `1.txt` and `2.txt` will be copied to `/dst/`.

$H4 Experiment 3: syncing file delete operation

  Continuing from the end of Experiment 2:

    hdfs dfs -rm -skipTrash /dst/2.txt
    # Create snap2 at destination, it contains 1.txt
    hdfs dfs -createSnapshot /dst/ snap2

    # Delete 1.txt from source
    hdfs dfs -rm -skipTrash /src/1.txt
    # Create snap4 at source, it only contains 2.txt
    hdfs dfs -createSnapshot /src/ snap4

  Run sync command now:

    hadoop distcp -update -diff snap2 snap4 /src/ /dst/

  `2.txt` is copied and `1.txt` is deleted under `/dst/`.

  Note that, though both `/src/` and `/dst/` have snapshot with the same name
  `snap2`, the snapshots don't need to have the same content.
  That means, if you have a `1.txt` in `/dst/`'s `snap2` but they have different
  contents, `1.txt` will still be removed from `/dst/`.
  The sync command doesn't check the contents of the files that is going to
  be deleted. It simply follows the snapshot diff list between `<from_snapshot>`
    and <to_snapshot>.

  Also, if we delete `1.txt` from `/dst/` before creating `snap2` on `/dst/`
  in the steps above, so that `/dst/`'s `snap2` doesn't have `1.txt` before
  running sync command, the command will still succeed. It won't throw exception
  while trying to delete `1.txt` from `/dst/` which doesn't exist.

$H3 raw Namespace Extended Attribute Preservation

  This section only applies to HDFS.

  If the target and all of the source pathnames are in the `/.reserved/raw`
  hierarchy, then 'raw' namespace extended attributes will be preserved.
  'raw' xattrs are used by the system for internal functions such as encryption
  meta data. They are only visible to users when accessed through the
  `/.reserved/raw` hierarchy.

  raw xattrs are preserved based solely on whether /.reserved/raw prefixes are
  supplied. The -p (preserve, see below) flag does not impact preservation of
  raw xattrs.

  To prevent raw xattrs from being preserved, simply do not use the
  `/.reserved/raw` prefix on any of the source and target paths.

  If the `/.reserved/raw `prefix is specified on only a subset of the source and
  target paths, an error will be displayed and a non-0 exit code returned.

Command Line Options
--------------------

| Flag              | Description                          | Notes |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------ | -------- |
| `-p[rbugpcaxte]` | Preserve r: replication number b: block size u: user g: group p: permission c: checksum-type a: ACL x: XAttr t: timestamp e: erasure coding policy | When `-update` is specified, status updates will **not** be synchronized unless the file sizes also differ (i.e. unless the file is re-created). If -pa is specified, DistCp preserves the permissions also because ACLs are a super-set of permissions. The option -pr is only valid if both source and target directory are not erasure coded. |
| `-i` | Ignore failures | As explained in the Appendix, this option will keep more accurate statistics about the copy than the default case. It also preserves logs from failed copies, which can be valuable for debugging. Finally, a failing map will not cause the job to fail before all splits are attempted. |
| `-log <logdir>` | Write logs to \<logdir\> | DistCp keeps logs of each file it attempts to copy as map output. If a map fails, the log output will not be retained if it is re-executed. |
| `-v` | Log additional info (path, size) in the SKIP/COPY log | This option can only be used with -log option. |
| `-m <num_maps>` | Maximum number of simultaneous copies | Specify the number of maps to copy data. Note that more maps may not necessarily improve throughput. |
| `-overwrite` | Overwrite destination | If a map fails and `-i` is not specified, all the files in the split, not only those that failed, will be recopied. As discussed in the Usage documentation, it also changes the semantics for generating destination paths, so users should use this carefully. |
| `-update` | Overwrite if source and destination differ in size, blocksize, or checksum | As noted in the preceding, this is not a "sync" operation. The criteria examined are the source and destination file sizes, blocksizes, and checksums; if they differ, the source file replaces the destination file. As discussed in the Usage documentation, it also changes the semantics for generating destination paths, so users should use this carefully. |
| `-append` | Incremental copy of file with same name but different length | If the source file is greater in length than the destination file, the checksum of the common length part is compared. If the checksum matches, only the difference is copied using read and append functionalities. The -append option only works with `-update` without `-skipcrccheck` |
| `-f <urilist_uri>` | Use list at \<urilist_uri\> as src list | This is equivalent to listing each source on the command line. The `urilist_uri` list should be a fully qualified URI. |
| `-filters` | The path to a file containing a list of pattern strings, one string per line, such that paths matching the pattern will be excluded from the copy. | Support regular expressions specified by java.util.regex.Pattern. |
| `-filelimit <n>` | Limit the total number of files to be <= n | **Deprecated!** Ignored in the new DistCp. |
| `-sizelimit <n>` | Limit the total size to be <= n bytes | **Deprecated!** Ignored in the new DistCp. |
| `-delete` | Delete the files existing in the dst but not in src | The deletion is done by FS Shell. So the trash will be used, if it is enable. Delete is applicable only with update or overwrite options. |
| `-strategy {dynamic\|uniformsize\|uniformrecord}` | Choose the copy-strategy to be used in DistCp. | By default, uniformsize is used. (i.e. Maps are balanced on the total size of files copied by each map. Similar to legacy.) If uniformrecord is used, Maps are balanced on the total number of files copied by each map, this is especially useful when there are lots of empty directories. If "dynamic" is specified, `DynamicInputFormat` is used instead. (This is described in the Architecture section, under InputFormats.) |
| `-bandwidth` | Specify bandwidth per map, in MB/second. | Each map will be restricted to consume only the specified bandwidth. This is not always exact. The map throttles back its bandwidth consumption during a copy, such that the **net** bandwidth used tends towards the specified value. |
| `-atomic {-tmp <tmp_dir>}` | Specify atomic commit, with optional tmp directory. | `-atomic` instructs DistCp to copy the source data to a temporary target location, and then move the temporary target to the final-location atomically. Data will either be available at final target in a complete and consistent form, or not at all. Optionally, `-tmp` may be used to specify the location of the tmp-target. If not specified, a default is chosen. **Note:** tmp_dir must be on the final target cluster. |
| `-async` | Run DistCp asynchronously. Quits as soon as the Hadoop Job is launched. | The Hadoop Job-id is logged, for tracking. |
| `-diff <oldSnapshot> <newSnapshot>` | Use snapshot diff report between given two snapshots to identify the difference between source and target, and apply the diff to the target to make it in sync with source. | This option is valid only with `-update` option and the following conditions should be satisfied. <ol><li> Both the source and the target FileSystem must be DistributedFileSystem.</li> <li> Two snapshots `<oldSnapshot>` and `<newSnapshot>` have been created on the source FS, and `<oldSnapshot>` is older than `<newSnapshot>`. </li> <li> The target has the same snapshot `<oldSnapshot>`. No changes have been made on the target since `<oldSnapshot>` was created, thus `<oldSnapshot>` has the same content as the current state of the target. All the files/directories in the target are the same with source's `<oldSnapshot>`.</li></ol> |
| `-rdiff <newSnapshot> <oldSnapshot>` | Use snapshot diff report between given two snapshots to identify what has been changed on the target since the snapshot `<oldSnapshot>` was created on the target, and apply the diff reversely to the target, and copy modified files from the source's `<oldSnapshot>`, to make the target the same as `<oldSnapshot>`. | This option is valid only with `-update` option and the following conditions should be satisfied. <ol><li>Both the source and the target FileSystem must be DistributedFileSystem. The source and the target can be two different clusters/paths, or they can be exactly the same cluster/path. In the latter case, modified files are copied from target's `<oldSnapshot>` to target's current state).</li>  <li> Two snapshots `<newSnapshot>` and `<oldSnapshot>` have been created on the target FS, and `<oldSnapshot>` is older than `<newSnapshot>`. No change has been made on target since `<newSnapshot>` was created on the target. </li> <li> The source has the same snapshot `<oldSnapshot>`, which has the same content as the `<oldSnapshot>` on the target. All the files/directories in the target's `<oldSnapshot>` are the same with source's `<oldSnapshot>`.</li> </ol> |
| `-numListstatusThreads` | Number of threads to use for building file listing | At most 40 threads. |
| `-skipcrccheck` | Whether to skip CRC checks between source and target paths. | |
| `-blocksperchunk <blocksperchunk>` | Number of blocks per chunk. When specified, split files into chunks to copy in parallel | If set to a positive value, files with more blocks than this value will be split into chunks of `<blocksperchunk>` blocks to be transferred in parallel, and reassembled on the destination. By default, `<blocksperchunk>` is 0 and the files will be transmitted in their entirety without splitting. This switch is only applicable when the source file system implements getBlockLocations method and the target file system implements concat method. |
| `-copybuffersize <copybuffersize>` | Size of the copy buffer to use. By default, `<copybuffersize>` is set to 8192B | |
| `-xtrack <path>` | Save information about missing source files to the specified path. | This option is only valid with `-update` option. This is an experimental property and it cannot be used with `-atomic` option. |
| `-direct` | Write directly to destination paths | Useful for avoiding potentially very expensive temporary file rename operations when the destination is an object store |
| `-useiterator` | Uses single threaded listStatusIterator to build listing | Useful for saving memory at the client side. Using this option will ignore the numListstatusThreads option |
| `-updateRoot` | Update root directory attributes (eg permissions, ownership ...) | Useful if you need to enforce root directory attributes update when using distcp |

Architecture of DistCp
----------------------

  The components of the new DistCp may be classified into the following
  categories:

  * DistCp Driver
  * Copy-listing generator
  * Input-formats and Map-Reduce components

$H3 DistCp Driver

  The DistCp Driver components are responsible for:

  * Parsing the arguments passed to the DistCp command on the command-line,
    via:

     * OptionsParser, and
     * DistCpOptionsSwitch

  * Assembling the command arguments into an appropriate DistCpOptions object,
    and initializing DistCp. These arguments include:

     * Source-paths
     * Target location
     * Copy options (e.g. whether to update-copy, overwrite, which
       file-attributes to preserve, etc.)

  * Orchestrating the copy operation by:

     * Invoking the copy-listing-generator to create the list of files to be
       copied.
     * Setting up and launching the Hadoop Map-Reduce Job to carry out the
       copy.
     * Based on the options, either returning a handle to the Hadoop MR Job
       immediately, or waiting till completion.

  The parser-elements are exercised only from the command-line (or if
  DistCp::run() is invoked). The DistCp class may also be used
  programmatically, by constructing the DistCpOptions object, and initializing
  a DistCp object appropriately.

$H3 Copy-listing Generator

  The copy-listing-generator classes are responsible for creating the list of
  files/directories to be copied from source. They examine the contents of the
  source-paths (files/directories, including wild-cards), and record all paths
  that need copy into a SequenceFile, for consumption by the DistCp Hadoop
  Job. The main classes in this module include:

  1. `CopyListing`: The interface that should be implemented by any
     copy-listing-generator implementation. Also provides the factory method by
     which the concrete CopyListing implementation is chosen.
  2. `SimpleCopyListing`: An implementation of `CopyListing` that accepts multiple
     source paths (files/directories), and recursively lists all the individual
     files and directories under each, for copy.
  3. `GlobbedCopyListing`: Another implementation of `CopyListing` that expands
     wild-cards in the source paths.
  4. `FileBasedCopyListing`: An implementation of `CopyListing` that reads the
     source-path list from a specified file.

  Based on whether a source-file-list is specified in the DistCpOptions, the
  source-listing is generated in one of the following ways:

  1. If there's no source-file-list, the `GlobbedCopyListing` is used. All
     wild-cards are expanded, and all the expansions are forwarded to the
     SimpleCopyListing, which in turn constructs the listing (via recursive
     descent of each path).
  2. If a source-file-list is specified, the `FileBasedCopyListing` is used.
     Source-paths are read from the specified file, and then forwarded to the
     `GlobbedCopyListing`. The listing is then constructed as described above.

  One may customize the method by which the copy-listing is constructed by
  providing a custom implementation of the CopyListing interface. The behaviour
  of DistCp differs here from the legacy DistCp, in how paths are considered
  for copy.

  One may also customize the filtering of files which shouldn't be copied
  by passing the current supported implementation of CopyFilter interface
  or a new implementation can be written. This can be specified by setting the
  `distcp.filters.class` in the DistCpOptions:

  1. `distcp.filters.class` to "RegexCopyFilter". If you are using this implementation,
     you will have to pass along "CopyFilter" `distcp.filters.file` which contains the
     regex used for filtering. Support regular expressions specified by
     java.util.regex.Pattern.
  2. `distcp.filters.class` to "RegexpInConfigurationFilter". If you are using this
     implementation, you will have to pass along the regex also using
     `distcp.exclude-file-regex` parameter in "DistCpOptions". Support regular
     expressions specified by java.util.regex.Pattern. This is a more dynamic approach
     as compared to "RegexCopyFilter".
  3. `distcp.filters.class` to "DirCopyFilter". If you are using this
       implementation, you will filter out all files and only directories remains.
       What's more, you can overwrite shouldCopy(CopyListingFileStatus fileStatus) method,
       which gives you a more fluent way to filter files/dirs by their file statuses.
       (i.e. A file status contains a lot of useful info such as file path, file length,
       isDir, modificationTime, owner, etc. You can use them in your own way
       by extends FileStatusCopyFilter class)
  4. `distcp.filters.class` to "TrueCopyFilter". This is used as a default
     implementation if none of the above options are specified.

  The legacy implementation only lists those paths that must definitely be
  copied on to target. E.g. if a file already exists at the target (and
  `-overwrite` isn't specified), the file isn't even considered in the
  MapReduce Copy Job. Determining this during setup (i.e. before the MapReduce
  Job) involves file-size and checksum-comparisons that are potentially
  time-consuming.

  The new DistCp postpones such checks until the MapReduce Job, thus reducing
  setup time. Performance is enhanced further since these checks are
  parallelized across multiple maps.

$H3 InputFormats and MapReduce Components

  The InputFormats and MapReduce components are responsible for the actual copy
  of files and directories from the source to the destination path. The
  listing-file created during copy-listing generation is consumed at this
  point, when the copy is carried out. The classes of interest here include:

  * **UniformSizeInputFormat:**
    This implementation of org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.InputFormat provides
    equivalence with Legacy DistCp in balancing load across maps. The aim of
    the UniformSizeInputFormat is to make each map copy roughly the same number
    of bytes. Apropos, the listing file is split into groups of paths, such
    that the sum of file-sizes in each InputSplit is nearly equal to every
    other map. The splitting isn't always perfect, but its trivial
    implementation keeps the setup-time low.

  * **UniformRecordInputFormat:**
    This implementation of org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.InputFormat provides
    equivalence with Legacy DistCp in balancing load across maps too. The aim of
    the UniformRecordInputFormat is to make each map copy roughly the same number
    of file/directories. Apropos, the listing file is split into groups of paths, such
    that the sum of file/directories number in each InputSplit is nearly equal to every
    other map. The splitting isn't always perfect, but its trivial
    implementation keeps the setup-time low. This implementation is especially useful
    when there are lots of empty directories to be copied.

  * **DynamicInputFormat and DynamicRecordReader:**
    The DynamicInputFormat implements `org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.InputFormat`,
    and is new to DistCp. The listing-file is split into several "chunk-files",
    the exact number of chunk-files being a multiple of the number of maps
    requested for in the Hadoop Job. Each map task is "assigned" one of the
    chunk-files (by renaming the chunk to the task's id), before the Job is
    launched.
    Paths are read from each chunk using the `DynamicRecordReader`, and
    processed in the CopyMapper. After all the paths in a chunk are processed,
    the current chunk is deleted and a new chunk is acquired. The process
    continues until no more chunks are available.
    This "dynamic" approach allows faster map-tasks to consume more paths than
    slower ones, thus speeding up the DistCp job overall.

  * **CopyMapper:**
    This class implements the physical file-copy. The input-paths are checked
    against the input-options (specified in the Job's Configuration), to
    determine whether a file needs copy. A file will be copied only if at least
    one of the following is true:

     * A file with the same name doesn't exist at target.
     * A file with the same name exists at target, but has a different file
       size.
     * A file with the same name exists at target, but has a different
       checksum, and `-skipcrccheck` isn't mentioned.
     * A file with the same name exists at target, but `-overwrite` is
       specified.
     * A file with the same name exists at target, but differs in block-size
       and block-size needs to be preserved.

  * **CopyCommitter:** This class is responsible for the commit-phase of the
    DistCp job, including:

     * Preservation of directory-permissions (if specified in the options)
     * Clean-up of temporary-files, work-directories, etc.

$H3 Map sizing

  By default, DistCp makes an attempt to size each map comparably so that each
  copies roughly the same number of bytes. Note that files are the finest level
  of granularity, so increasing the number of simultaneous copiers (i.e. maps)
  may not always increase the number of simultaneous copies nor the overall
  throughput.

  The new DistCp also provides a strategy to "dynamically" size maps, allowing
  faster data-nodes to copy more bytes than slower nodes. Using `-strategy
  dynamic` (explained in the Architecture), rather than to assign a fixed set
  of source-files to each map-task, files are instead split into several sets.
  The number of sets exceeds the number of maps, usually by a factor of 2-3.
  Each map picks up and copies all files listed in a chunk. When a chunk is
  exhausted, a new chunk is acquired and processed, until no more chunks
  remain.

  By not assigning a source-path to a fixed map, faster map-tasks (i.e.
  data-nodes) are able to consume more chunks, and thus copy more data, than
  slower nodes. While this distribution isn't uniform, it is fair with regard
  to each mapper's capacity.

  The dynamic-strategy is implemented by the `DynamicInputFormat`. It provides
  superior performance under most conditions.

  Tuning the number of maps to the size of the source and destination clusters,
  the size of the copy, and the available bandwidth is recommended for
  long-running and regularly run jobs.

$H3 Copying Between Versions of HDFS

  For copying between two different major versions of Hadoop (e.g. between 1.X
  and 2.X), one will usually use WebHdfsFileSystem. Unlike the previous
  HftpFileSystem, as webhdfs is available for both read and write operations,
  DistCp can be run on both source and destination cluster.
  Remote cluster is specified as `webhdfs://<namenode_hostname>:<http_port>`.
  When copying between same major versions of Hadoop cluster (e.g. between 2.X
  and 2.X), use hdfs protocol for better performance.

$H3 Secure Copy over the wire with distcp
  Use the "`swebhdfs://`" scheme when webhdfs is secured with SSL. For more information see [SSL Configurations for SWebHDFS](../hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-hdfs/WebHDFS.html#SSL_Configurations_for_SWebHDFS).

$H3 MapReduce and other side-effects

  As has been mentioned in the preceding, should a map fail to copy one of its
  inputs, there will be several side-effects.

  * Unless `-overwrite` is specified, files successfully copied by a previous
    map on a re-execution will be marked as "skipped".
  * If a map fails `mapreduce.map.maxattempts` times, the remaining map tasks
    will be killed (unless `-i` is set).
  * If `mapreduce.map.speculative` is set to be true, the result of the
    copy is undefined.

$H3 DistCp and Object Stores

DistCp works with Object Stores such as Amazon S3, Azure ABFS and Google GCS.

Prequisites

1. The JAR containing the object store implementation is on the classpath,
along with all of its dependencies.
1. Unless the JAR automatically registers its bundled filesystem clients,
the configuration may need to be modified to state the class which
implements the filesystem schema. All of the ASF's own object store clients
are self-registering.
1. The relevant object store access credentials must be available in the cluster
configuration, or be otherwise available in all cluster hosts.

DistCp can be used to upload data

```bash
hadoop distcp -direct hdfs://nn1:8020/datasets/set1 s3a://bucket/datasets/set1
```

To download data

```bash
hadoop distcp s3a://bucket/generated/results hdfs://nn1:8020/results
```

To copy data between object stores

```bash
hadoop distcp s3a://bucket/generated/results \
  wasb://updates@example.blob.core.windows.net
```

And do copy data within an object store

```bash
hadoop distcp wasb://updates@example.blob.core.windows.net/current \
  wasb://updates@example.blob.core.windows.net/old
```

And to use `-update` to only copy changed files.

```bash
hadoop distcp -update -numListstatusThreads 20  \
  s3a://history/2016 \
  hdfs://nn1:8020/history/2016
```

Because object stores are slow to list files, consider setting the `-numListstatusThreads` option when performing a `-update` operation
on a large directory tree (the limit is 40 threads).

When `DistCp -update` is used with object stores, generally only the
modification time and length of the individual files are compared, not any
checksums if the checksum algorithm between the two stores is different.

* The `distcp -update` between two object stores with different checksum
  algorithm compares the modification times of source and target files along
  with the file size to determine whether to skip the file copy. The behavior
  is controlled by the property `distcp.update.modification.time`, which is
  set to true by default. If the source file is more recently modified than
  the target file, it is assumed that the content has changed, and the file
  should be updated.
  We need to ensure that there is no clock skew between the machines.
  The fact that most object stores do have valid timestamps for directories
  is irrelevant; only the file timestamps are compared. However, it is
  important to have the clock of the client computers close to that of the
  infrastructure, so that timestamps are consistent between the client/HDFS
  cluster and that of the object store. Otherwise, changed files may be
  missed/copied too often.

* `distcp.update.modification.time` would only be used if either of the two
  stores don't have checksum validation resulting in incompatible checksum
  comparison between the two. Even if the property is set to true, it won't
  be used if there is valid checksum comparison between the two stores.

To turn off the modification time check, set this in your core-site.xml
```xml
<property>
        <name>distcp.update.modification.time</name>
        <value>false</value>
</property>
```

**Notes**

* The `-atomic` option causes a rename of the temporary data, so significantly
increases the time to commit work at the end of the operation. Furthermore,
as Object Stores other than (optionally) `wasb://` do not offer atomic renames of directories
the `-atomic` operation doesn't actually deliver what is promised. *Avoid*.

* The `-append` option is not supported.

* The `-diff` and `rdiff` options are not supported

* CRC checking will not be performed, irrespective of the value of the `-skipCrc`
flag.

* All `-p` options, including those to preserve permissions, user and group information, attributes
checksums and replication are generally ignored. The `wasb://` connector will
preserve the information, but not enforce the permissions.

* Some object store connectors offer an option for in-memory buffering of
output â€”for example the S3A connector. Using such option while copying
large files may trigger some form of out of memory event,
be it a heap overflow or a YARN container termination.
This is particularly common if the network bandwidth
between the cluster and the object store is limited (such as when working
with remote object stores). It is best to disable/avoid such options and
rely on disk buffering.

* Copy operations within a single object store still take place in the Hadoop cluster
â€”even when the object store implements a more efficient COPY operation internally

    That is, an operation such as

      hadoop distcp s3a://bucket/datasets/set1 s3a://bucket/datasets/set2

    Copies each byte down to the Hadoop worker nodes and back to the
bucket. As well as being slow, it means that charges may be incurred.

* The `-direct` option can be used to write to object store target paths directly,
avoiding the potentially very expensive temporary file rename operations that would
otherwise occur.

Frequently Asked Questions
--------------------------

  1. **Why does -update not create the parent source-directory under a pre-existing target directory?**
     The behaviour of `-update` and `-overwrite` is described in detail in the
     Usage section of this document. In short, if either option is used with a
     pre-existing destination directory, the **contents** of each source
     directory is copied over, rather than the source-directory itself. This
     behaviour is consistent with the legacy DistCp implementation as well.

  2. **How does the new DistCp differs in semantics from the Legacy DistCp?**

     * Files that are skipped during copy used to also have their
       file-attributes (permissions, owner/group info, etc.) unchanged, when
       copied with Legacy DistCp. These are now updated, even if the file-copy
       is skipped.
     * Empty root directories among the source-path inputs were not created at
       the target, in Legacy DistCp. These are now created.

  3. **Why does the new DistCp use more maps than legacy DistCp?**
     Legacy DistCp works by figuring out what files need to be actually copied
     to target before the copy-job is launched, and then launching as many maps
     as required for copy. So if a majority of the files need to be skipped
     (because they already exist, for example), fewer maps will be needed. As a
     consequence, the time spent in setup (i.e. before the M/R job) is higher.
     The new DistCp calculates only the contents of the source-paths. It
     doesn't try to filter out what files can be skipped. That decision is put
     off till the M/R job runs. This is much faster (vis-a-vis execution-time),
     but the number of maps launched will be as specified in the `-m` option,
     or 20 (default) if unspecified.

  4. **Why does DistCp not run faster when more maps are specified?**
     At present, the smallest unit of work for DistCp is a file. i.e., a file
     is processed by only one map. Increasing the number of maps to a value
     exceeding the number of files would yield no performance benefit. The
     number of maps launched would equal the number of files.

  5. **Why does DistCp run out of memory?**
     If the number of individual files/directories being copied from the source
     path(s) is extremely large (e.g. 1,000,000 paths), DistCp might run out of
     memory while determining the list of paths for copy. This is not unique to
     the new DistCp implementation.
     To get around this, consider changing the `-Xmx` JVM heap-size parameters,
     as follows:

         bash$ export HADOOP_CLIENT_OPTS="-Xms64m -Xmx1024m"
         bash$ hadoop distcp /source /target
