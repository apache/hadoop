    Jobs are added to queues and schedulers can configure different 
    scheduling properties for the various queues. To configure a property 
    for a queue, the name of the queue must match the name specified in this 
    value. Queue properties that are common to all schedulers are configured 
    here with the naming convention, mapred.queue.$QUEUE-NAME.$PROPERTY-NAME,
    for e.g. mapred.queue.default.submit-job-acl.
    The number of queues configured in this parameter could depend on the
    type of scheduler being used, as specified in 
    mapred.jobtracker.taskScheduler. For example, the JobQueueTaskScheduler
    supports only a single queue, which is the default configured here.
    Before adding more queues, ensure that the scheduler you've configured
    supports multiple queues.
