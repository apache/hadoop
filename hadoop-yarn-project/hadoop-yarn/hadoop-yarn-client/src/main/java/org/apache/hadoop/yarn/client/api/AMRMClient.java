   * Object to represent a single container request for resources. Scheduler
   * documentation should be consulted for the specifics of how the parameters

   * 
   * By default, YARN schedulers try to allocate containers at the requested
   * locations but they may relax the constraints in order to expedite meeting
   * allocations limits. They first relax the constraint to the same rack as the
   * requested node and then to anywhere in the cluster. The relaxLocality flag
   * may be used to disable locality relaxation and request containers at only 
   * specific locations. The following conditions apply.
   * <ul>
   * <li>Within a priority, all container requests must have the same value for
   * locality relaxation. Either enabled or disabled.</li>
   * <li>If locality relaxation is disabled, then across requests, locations at
   * different network levels may not be specified. E.g. its invalid to make a
   * request for a specific node and another request for a specific rack.</li>
   * <li>If locality relaxation is disabled, then only within the same request,  
   * a node and its rack may be specified together. This allows for a specific   
   * rack with a preference for a specific node within that rack.</li>
   * <li></li>
   * </ul>
   * To re-enable locality relaxation at a given priority, all pending requests 
   * with locality relaxation disabled must be first removed. Then they can be 
   * added back with locality relaxation enabled.
   * 
   * All getters return immutable values.
