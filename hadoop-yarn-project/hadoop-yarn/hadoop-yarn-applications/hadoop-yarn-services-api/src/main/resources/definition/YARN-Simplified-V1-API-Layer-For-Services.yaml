  title: "[YARN-4793] Simplified API layer for services and beyond"
  description: |
    Bringing a new service on YARN today is not a simple experience. The APIs of existing frameworks are either too low level (native YARN), require writing new code (for frameworks with programmatic APIs) or writing a complex spec (for declarative frameworks). In addition to building critical building blocks inside YARN (as part of other efforts at link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YARN-4692[YARN-4692]), there is a need for simplifying the user facing story for building services. Experience of projects like Apache Slider running real-life services like HBase, Storm, Accumulo, Solr etc, gives us some very good insights on how simplified APIs for services should look like.


    To this end, we should look at a new simple-services API layer backed by REST interfaces. This API can be used to create and manage the lifecycle of YARN services. Services here can range from simple single-component apps to complex multi-component assemblies needing orchestration.


    We should also look at making this a unified REST based entry point for other important features like resource-profile management (link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YARN-3926[YARN-3926]), package-definitions' lifecycle-management and service-discovery (link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YARN-913[YARN-913]/link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YARN-4757[YARN-4757]). We also need to flesh out its relation to our present much lower level REST APIs (link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YARN-1695[YARN-1695]) in YARN for application-submission and management.


    This document spotlights on this specification. In most of the cases, the application owner will not be forced to make any changes to their application. This is primarily true if the application is packaged with containerization technologies like docker. Irrespective of how complex the application is, there will be hooks provided at appropriate layers to allow pluggable and customizable application behavior.

      summary: Create an application/service
      description: Create an application. The request JSON is an Application object with details required for creation. If the request is successful it returns 202 Accepted. A success of this API only confirms success in submission of the application creation request. There is no guarantee that the application will actually reach a RUNNING state. Resource availability and several other factors determines if the application will be deployed in the cluster. It is expected that clients would subsequently call the GET API to get details of the application and determine its state.

        format: int64
        description: In get response this provides the total number of running containers for this application (across all components) at the time of request. Note, a subsequent request can return a different number as and when more containers get allocated until it reaches the total number of containers or if a flex request has been made between the two requests.
      lifetime:
        type: integer
        format: int64
        description: Life time (in seconds) of the application from the time it reaches the STARTED state (after which it is automatically destroyed by YARN). For unlimited lifetime do not set a lifetime value.

  Resource:
    description:
      Resource determines the amount of resources (vcores, memory, network, etc.) usable by a container. This field determines the resource to be applied for all the containers of a component or application. The resource specified at the app (or global) level can be overriden at the component level.

      label:
        type: string
        description: Assigns an app to a named partition of the cluster where the application desires to run (optional). If not specified all apps are submitted to a default label of the app owner. One or more labels can be setup for each application owner account with required constraints like no-preemption, sla-99999, preemption-ok, etc.
  Artifact:
    description: Artifact of an application component.
    required:
    - id
    properties:
      id:

      uri:
        type: string
        description: Artifact location to support multiple artifact stores (optional).
  Component:
    description: One or more components of the application. If the application is HBase say, then the component can be a simple role like master or regionserver. If the application is a complex business webapp then a component can be other applications say Kafka or Storm. Thereby it opens up the support for complex and nested applications.
    required:
    - name
    properties:
      name:
        type: string
        description: Name of the application component (mandatory).

      readiness_check:
        description: Readiness check for this app-component.
        $ref: '#/definitions/ReadinessCheck'
      artifact:
        description: Artifact of the component (optional). If not specified, the application level global artifact takes effect.
        $ref: '#/definitions/Artifact'
      launch_command:

        $ref: '#/definitions/Resource'
      number_of_containers:
        type: integer
        format: int64
        description: Number of containers for this app-component (optional). If not specified, the application level global number_of_containers takes effect.
      unique_component_support:
        type: boolean
        description: Certain applications need to define multiple components using the same artifact and resource profile, differing only in configurations. In such cases, this field helps app owners to avoid creating multiple component definitions with repeated information. The number_of_containers field dictates the initial number of components created. Component names typically differ with a trailing id, but assumptions should not be made on that, as the algorithm can change at any time. Configurations section will be able to use placeholders like ${USER}, ${CLUSTER_NAME} and ${COMPONENT_NAME} to be replaced at runtime with user the app is submitted as, application name and application component name respectively. Launch command can use placeholders like ${APP_COMPONENT_NAME} and ${APP_NAME} to get its component name and app name respectively at runtime. The best part of this feature is that when the component is flexed up, entirely new components (with new trailing ids) are created.
      run_privileged_container:
        type: boolean
        description: Run all containers of this component in privileged mode (YARN-4262).
      placement_policy:

        description: A list of quicklink keys defined at the application level, and to be resolved by this component.
  ReadinessCheck:
    description: A custom command or a pluggable helper container to determine the readiness of a container of a component. Readiness for every application is different. Hence the need for a simple interface, with scope to support advanced usecases.
    required:
    - uri
    properties:

        enum:
          - http
      uri:
        type: string
        description: Fully qualified REST uri endpoint.
      artifact:
        description: Artifact of the pluggable readiness check helper container (optional). If specified, this helper container typically hosts the http uri and encapsulates the complex scripts required to perform actual container readiness check. At the end it is expected to respond a 204 No content just like the simplified use case. This pluggable framework benefits application owners who can run applications without any packaging modifications. Note, artifacts of type docker only is supported for now.
        $ref: '#/definitions/Artifact'
  Configuration:
    description: Set of configuration properties that can be injected into the application components via envs, files and custom pluggable helper docker containers. Files of several standard formats like xml, properties, json, yaml and templates will be supported.
