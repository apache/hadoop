HDFS Commands Guide
===================

<!-- MACRO{toc|fromDepth=0|toDepth=2} -->

Overview
--------

All HDFS commands are invoked by the `bin/hdfs` script. Running the hdfs script without any arguments prints the description for all commands.

Usage: `hdfs [SHELL_OPTIONS] COMMAND [GENERIC_OPTIONS] [COMMAND_OPTIONS]`

Hadoop has an option parsing framework that employs parsing generic options as well as running classes.

| COMMAND\_OPTIONS | Description |
|:---- |:---- |
| SHELL\_OPTIONS | The common set of shell options. These are documented on the [Commands Manual](../../hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-common/CommandsManual.html#Shell_Options) page. |
| GENERIC\_OPTIONS | The common set of options supported by multiple commands. See the Hadoop [Commands Manual](../../hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-common/CommandsManual.html#Generic_Options) for more information. |
| COMMAND\_OPTIONS | Various commands with their options are described in the following sections. The commands have been grouped into [User Commands](#User_Commands) and [Administration Commands](#Administration_Commands). |

User Commands
-------------

Commands useful for users of a hadoop cluster.

### `classpath`

Usage: `hdfs classpath [--glob |--jar <path> |-h |--help]`

| COMMAND\_OPTION | Description |
|:---- |:---- |
| `--glob` | expand wildcards |
| `--jar` *path* | write classpath as manifest in jar named *path* |
| `-h`, `--help` | print help |

Prints the class path needed to get the Hadoop jar and the required libraries. If called without arguments, then prints the classpath set up by the command scripts, which is likely to contain wildcards in the classpath entries. Additional options print the classpath after wildcard expansion or write the classpath into the manifest of a jar file. The latter is useful in environments where wildcards cannot be used and the expanded classpath exceeds the maximum supported command line length.

### `dfs`

Usage: `hdfs dfs [COMMAND [COMMAND_OPTIONS]]`

Run a filesystem command on the file system supported in Hadoop. The various COMMAND\_OPTIONS can be found at [File System Shell Guide](../hadoop-common/FileSystemShell.html).

Administration Commands
-----------------------

Commands useful for administrators of a hadoop cluster.

              [-policy <policy>]
              [-threshold <threshold>]
              [-exclude [-f <hosts-file> | <comma-separated list of hosts>]]
              [-include [-f <hosts-file> | <comma-separated list of hosts>]]
              [-source [-f <hosts-file> | <comma-separated list of hosts>]]
              [-blockpools <comma-separated list of blockpool ids>]
              [-idleiterations <idleiterations>]
              [-runDuringUpgrade]
              [-asService]
              [-sortTopNodes]
              [-hotBlockTimeInterval <specified time interval>]

| COMMAND\_OPTION | Description |
|:---- |:---- |
| `-policy` \<policy\> | `datanode` (default): Cluster is balanced if each datanode is balanced.<br/> `blockpool`: Cluster is balanced if each block pool in each datanode is balanced. |
| `-threshold` \<threshold\> | Percentage of disk capacity. This overwrites the default threshold. |
| `-exclude -f` \<hosts-file\> \| \<comma-separated list of hosts\> | Excludes the specified datanodes from being balanced by the balancer. |
| `-include -f` \<hosts-file\> \| \<comma-separated list of hosts\> | Includes only the specified datanodes to be balanced by the balancer. |
| `-source -f` \<hosts-file\> \| \<comma-separated list of hosts\> | Pick only the specified datanodes as source nodes. |
| `-blockpools` \<comma-separated list of blockpool ids\> | The balancer will only run on blockpools included in this list. |
| `-idleiterations` \<iterations\> | Maximum number of idle iterations before exit. This overwrites the default idleiterations(5). |
| `-runDuringUpgrade` | Whether to run the balancer during an ongoing HDFS upgrade. This is usually not desired since it will not affect used space on over-utilized machines. |
| `-asService` | Run Balancer as a long running service. |
| `-sortTopNodes` | Sort datanodes based on the utilization so that highly utilized datanodes get scheduled first. |
| `-hotBlockTimeInterval` | Prefer moving cold blocks i.e blocks associated with files accessed or modified before the specified time interval. |
| `-h`\|`--help` | Display the tool usage and help information and exit. |

Runs a cluster balancing utility. An administrator can simply press Ctrl-C to stop the rebalancing process. See [Balancer](./HdfsUserGuide.html#Balancer) for more details.

Note that the `blockpool` policy is stricter than the `datanode` policy.

Besides the above command options, a pinning feature is introduced starting from 2.7.0 to prevent certain replicas from getting moved by balancer/mover. This pinning feature is disabled by default, and can be enabled by configuration property "dfs.datanode.block-pinning.enabled". When enabled, this feature only affects blocks that are written to favored nodes specified in the create() call. This feature is useful when we want to maintain the data locality, for applications such as HBase regionserver.

If you want to run Balancer as a long-running service, please start Balancer using `-asService` parameter with daemon-mode. You can do this by using the following command: `hdfs --daemon start balancer -asService`, or just use sbin/start-balancer.sh script with parameter `-asService`.

        hdfs dfsadmin [-help [cmd]]

| COMMAND\_OPTION | Description |
|:---- |:---- |
| `-report` `[-live]` `[-dead]` `[-decommissioning]` `[-enteringmaintenance]` `[-inmaintenance]` `[-slownodes]` | Reports basic filesystem information and statistics, The dfs usage can be different from "du" usage, because it measures raw space used by replication, checksums, snapshots and etc. on all the DNs. Optional flags may be used to filter the list of displayed DataNodes. Filters are either based on the DN state (e.g. live, dead, decommissioning) or the nature of the DN (e.g. slow nodes - nodes with higher latency than their peers). |
| `-safemode` enter\|leave\|get\|wait\|forceExit | Safe mode maintenance command. Safe mode is a Namenode state in which it <br/>1. does not accept changes to the name space (read-only) <br/>2. does not replicate or delete blocks. <br/>Safe mode is entered automatically at Namenode startup, and leaves safe mode automatically when the configured minimum percentage of blocks satisfies the minimum replication condition. If Namenode detects any anomaly then it will linger in safe mode till that issue is resolved. If that anomaly is the consequence of a deliberate action, then administrator can use -safemode forceExit to exit safe mode. The cases where forceExit may be required are<br/> 1. Namenode metadata is not consistent. If Namenode detects that metadata has been modified out of band and can cause data loss, then Namenode will enter forceExit state. At that point user can either restart Namenode with correct metadata files or forceExit (if data loss is acceptable).<br/>2. Rollback causes metadata to be replaced and rarely it can trigger safe mode forceExit state in Namenode. In that case you may proceed by issuing -safemode forceExit.<br/> Safe mode can also be entered manually, but then it can only be turned off manually as well. |
| `-saveNamespace` `[-beforeShutdown]` | Save current namespace into storage directories and reset edits log. Requires safe mode. If the "beforeShutdown" option is given, the NameNode does a checkpoint if and only if no checkpoint has been done during a time window (a configurable number of checkpoint periods). This is usually used before shutting down the NameNode to prevent potential fsimage/editlog corruption. |
| `-rollEdits` | Rolls the edit log on the active NameNode. |
| `-restoreFailedStorage` true\|false\|check | This option will turn on/off automatic attempt to restore failed storage replicas. If a failed storage becomes available again the system will attempt to restore edits and/or fsimage during checkpoint. 'check' option will return current setting. |
| `-refreshNodes` | Re-read the hosts and exclude files to update the set of Datanodes that are allowed to connect to the Namenode and those that should be decommissioned or recommissioned. |
| `-setQuota` \<quota\> \<dirname\>...\<dirname\> | See [HDFS Quotas Guide](../hadoop-hdfs/HdfsQuotaAdminGuide.html#Administrative_Commands) for the detail. |
| `-clrQuota` \<dirname\>...\<dirname\> | See [HDFS Quotas Guide](../hadoop-hdfs/HdfsQuotaAdminGuide.html#Administrative_Commands) for the detail. |
| `-setSpaceQuota` \<quota\> `[-storageType <storagetype>]` \<dirname\>...\<dirname\> | See [HDFS Quotas Guide](../hadoop-hdfs/HdfsQuotaAdminGuide.html#Administrative_Commands) for the detail. |
| `-clrSpaceQuota` `[-storageType <storagetype>]` \<dirname\>...\<dirname\> | See [HDFS Quotas Guide](../hadoop-hdfs/HdfsQuotaAdminGuide.html#Administrative_Commands) for the detail. |
| `-finalizeUpgrade` | Finalize upgrade of HDFS. Datanodes delete their previous version working directories, followed by Namenode doing the same. This completes the upgrade process. |
| `-rollingUpgrade` [\<query\>\|\<prepare\>\|\<finalize\>] | See [Rolling Upgrade document](../hadoop-hdfs/HdfsRollingUpgrade.html#dfsadmin_-rollingUpgrade) for the detail. |
| `-upgrade` query\|finalize | Query the current upgrade status.<br/>Finalize upgrade of HDFS (equivalent to -finalizeUpgrade). |
| `-refreshServiceAcl` | Reload the service-level authorization policy file. |
| `-refreshUserToGroupsMappings` | Refresh user-to-groups mappings. |
| `-refreshSuperUserGroupsConfiguration` | Refresh superuser proxy groups mappings |
| `-refreshCallQueue` | Reload the call queue from config. |
| `-refresh` \<host:ipc\_port\> \<key\> [arg1..argn] | Triggers a runtime-refresh of the resource specified by \<key\> on \<host:ipc\_port\>. All other args after are sent to the host. |
| `-reconfig` \<datanode \|namenode\> \<host:ipc\_port\|livenodes\|decomnodes\> \<start\|status\|properties\> | Starts reconfiguration or gets the status of an ongoing reconfiguration, or gets a list of reconfigurable properties. The second parameter specifies the node type. The third parameter specifies host address. For start or status, datanode supports livenodes and decomnodes as the third parameter, which will start or retrieve reconfiguration on all live or decommissioning datanodes. |
| `-printTopology` | Print a tree of the racks and their nodes as reported by the Namenode |
| `-refreshNamenodes` datanodehost:port | For the given datanode, reloads the configuration files, stops serving the removed block-pools and starts serving new block-pools. |
| `-getVolumeReport` datanodehost:port | For the given datanode, get the volume report. |
| `-deleteBlockPool` datanode-host:port blockpoolId [force] | If force is passed, block pool directory for the given blockpool id on the given datanode is deleted along with its contents, otherwise the directory is deleted only if it is empty. The command will fail if datanode is still serving the block pool. Refer to refreshNamenodes to shutdown a block pool service on a datanode. |
| `-setBalancerBandwidth` \<bandwidth in bytes per second\> | Changes the network bandwidth used by each datanode during HDFS block balancing. \<bandwidth\> is the maximum number of bytes per second that will be used by each datanode. This value overrides the dfs.datanode.balance.bandwidthPerSec parameter. NOTE: The new value is not persistent on the DataNode. |
| `-getBalancerBandwidth` \<datanode\_host:ipc\_port\> | Get the network bandwidth(in bytes per second) for the given datanode. This is the maximum network bandwidth used by the datanode during HDFS block balancing.|
| `-fetchImage` \<local directory\> | Downloads the most recent fsimage from the NameNode and saves it in the specified local directory. |
| `-allowSnapshot` \<snapshotDir\> | Allowing snapshots of a directory to be created. If the operation completes successfully, the directory becomes snapshottable. See the [HDFS Snapshot Documentation](./HdfsSnapshots.html) for more information. |
| `-disallowSnapshot` \<snapshotDir\> | Disallowing snapshots of a directory to be created. All snapshots of the directory must be deleted before disallowing snapshots. See the [HDFS Snapshot Documentation](./HdfsSnapshots.html) for more information. |

dfsadmin with ViewFsOverloadScheme
----------------------------------

Usage: `hdfs dfsadmin -fs <child fs mount link URI> <dfsadmin command options>`

| COMMAND\_OPTION | Description |
|:---- |:---- |
| `-fs` *child fs mount link URI* | Its a logical mount link path to child file system in ViewFS world. This uri typically formed as src mount link prefixed with fs.defaultFS. Please note, this is not an actual child file system uri, instead its a logical mount link uri pointing to actual child file system|

Example command usage:
   `hdfs dfsadmin -fs hdfs://nn1 -safemode enter`

In ViewFsOverloadScheme, we may have multiple child file systems as mount point mappings as shown in [ViewFsOverloadScheme Guide](./ViewFsOverloadScheme.html). Here -fs option is an optional generic parameter supported by dfsadmin. When users want to execute commands on one of the child file system, they need to pass that file system mount mapping link uri to -fs option. Let's take an example mount link configuration and dfsadmin command below.

Mount link:

```xml
<property>
  <name>fs.defaultFS</name>
  <value>hdfs://MyCluster1</value>
</property>

<property>
  <name>fs.viewfs.mounttable.MyCluster1./user</name>
  <value>hdfs://MyCluster2/user</value>
  <!-- mount table name : MyCluster1
       mount link mapping: hdfs://MyCluster1/user --> hdfs://MyCluster2/user
       mount link path: /user
       mount link uri: hdfs://MyCluster1/user
       mount target uri for /user: hdfs://MyCluster2/user -->
</property>
```

If user wants to talk to `hdfs://MyCluster2/`, then they can pass -fs option (`-fs hdfs://MyCluster1/user`)
Since /user was mapped to a cluster `hdfs://MyCluster2/user`, dfsadmin resolve the passed (`-fs hdfs://MyCluster1/user`) to target fs (`hdfs://MyCluster2/user`).
This way users can get the access to all hdfs child file systems in ViewFsOverloadScheme.
If there is no `-fs` option provided, then it will try to connect to the configured fs.defaultFS cluster if a cluster running with the fs.defaultFS uri.
