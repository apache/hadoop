HFTP Guide

%{toc|section=1|fromDepth=0}

* Introduction

   HFTP is a Hadoop filesystem implementation that lets you read data from
   a remote Hadoop HDFS cluster. The reads are done via HTTP, and data is
   sourced from DataNodes. HFTP is a read-only filesystem, and will throw
   exceptions if you try to use it to write data or modify the filesystem
   state.

   HFTP is primarily useful if you have multiple HDFS clusters with
   different versions and you need to move data from one to another. HFTP
   is wire-compatible even between different versions of HDFS. For
   example, you can do things like: <<<hadoop distcp -i hftp://sourceFS:50070/src hdfs://destFS:50070/dest>>>.
   Note that HFTP is read-only so the destination must be an HDFS filesystem.
   (Also, in this example, the distcp should be run using the configuraton of
   the new filesystem.)

   An extension, HSFTP, uses HTTPS by default. This means that data will
   be encrypted in transit.

* Implementation

   The code for HFTP lives in the Java class
   <<<org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.HftpFileSystem>>>. Likewise, HSFTP is implemented
   in <<<org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.HsftpFileSystem>>>.

* Configuration Options

*-----------------------:-----------------------------------+
| <<Name>>              | <<Description>>                   |
*-----------------------:-----------------------------------+
| <<<dfs.hftp.https.port>>> | the HTTPS port on the remote cluster. If not set,
|                       |   HFTP will fall back on <<<dfs.https.port>>>.
*-----------------------:-----------------------------------+
| <<<hdfs.service.host_ip:port>>> | Specifies the service name (for the security
|                       |  subsystem) associated with the HFTP filesystem running at ip:port.
*-----------------------:-----------------------------------+
