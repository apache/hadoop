    <em>HDFS rolling upgrade</em> allows upgrading individual HDFS daemons.
    For examples, the datanodes can be upgraded independent of the namenodes.
    A namenode can be upgraded independent of the other namenodes.
    The namenodes can be upgraded independent of datanods and journal nodes.
  </p>
  </section>

  <section name="Upgrade" id="Upgrade">
  <p>
    In Hadoop v2, HDFS supports highly-available (HA) namenode services and wire compatibility.
    These two capabilities make it feasible to upgrade HDFS without incurring HDFS downtime.
    In order to upgrade a HDFS cluster without downtime, the cluster must be setup with HA.
  </p>
  <p>
    If there is any new feature which is enabled in new software release, may not work with old software release after upgrade.
    In such cases upgrade should be done by following steps.
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Disable new feature.</li>
    <li>Upgrade the cluster.</li>
    <li>Enable the new feature.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    Note that rolling upgrade is supported only from Hadoop-2.4.0 onwards.
  </p>
  <subsection name="Upgrade without Downtime" id="UpgradeWithoutDowntime">
  <p>
    In a HA cluster, there are two or more <em>NameNodes (NNs)</em>, many <em>DataNodes (DNs)</em>,
    a few <em>JournalNodes (JNs)</em> and a few <em>ZooKeeperNodes (ZKNs)</em>.
    <em>JNs</em> is relatively stable and does not require upgrade when upgrading HDFS in most of the cases.
    In the rolling upgrade procedure described here,
    only <em>NNs</em> and <em>DNs</em> are considered but <em>JNs</em> and <em>ZKNs</em> are not.
    Upgrading <em>JNs</em> and <em>ZKNs</em> may incur cluster downtime.
  </p>

  <h4>Upgrading Non-Federated Clusters</h4>
  <p>
    Suppose there are two namenodes <em>NN1</em> and <em>NN2</em>,
    where <em>NN1</em> and <em>NN2</em> are respectively in active and standby states.
    The following are the steps for upgrading a HA cluster:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Prepare Rolling Upgrade<ol>
      <li>Run "<code><a href="#dfsadmin_-rollingUpgrade">hdfs dfsadmin -rollingUpgrade prepare</a></code>"
        to create a fsimage for rollback.
      </li>
      <li>Run "<code><a href="#dfsadmin_-rollingUpgrade">hdfs dfsadmin -rollingUpgrade query</a></code>"
        to check the status of the rollback image.
        Wait and re-run the command until
        the "<tt>Proceed with rolling upgrade</tt>" message is shown.
      </li>
    </ol></li>
    <li>Upgrade Active and Standby <em>NNs</em><ol>
      <li>Shutdown and upgrade <em>NN2</em>.</li>
      <li>Start <em>NN2</em> as standby with the
        "<a href="#namenode_-rollingUpgrade"><code>-rollingUpgrade started</code></a>" option.</li>
      <li>Failover from <em>NN1</em> to <em>NN2</em>
               so that <em>NN2</em> becomes active and <em>NN1</em> becomes standby.</li>
      <li>Shutdown and upgrade <em>NN1</em>.</li>
      <li>Start <em>NN1</em> as standby with the
        "<a href="#namenode_-rollingUpgrade"><code>-rollingUpgrade started</code></a>" option.</li>
    </ol></li>
    <li>Upgrade <em>DNs</em><ol>
      <li>Choose a small subset of datanodes (e.g. all datanodes under a particular rack).</li>
      <ol>
        <li>Run "<code><a href="#dfsadmin_-shutdownDatanode">hdfs dfsadmin -shutdownDatanode &lt;DATANODE_HOST:IPC_PORT&gt; upgrade</a></code>"
          to shutdown one of the chosen datanodes.</li>
        <li>Run "<code><a href="#dfsadmin_-getDatanodeInfo">hdfs dfsadmin -getDatanodeInfo &lt;DATANODE_HOST:IPC_PORT&gt;</a></code>"
          to check and wait for the datanode to shutdown.</li>
        <li>Upgrade and restart the datanode.</li>
        <li>Perform the above steps for all the chosen datanodes in the subset in parallel.</li>
      </ol>
      <li>Repeat the above steps until all datanodes in the cluster are upgraded.</li>
    </ol></li>
    <li>Finalize Rolling Upgrade<ul>
      <li>Run "<code><a href="#dfsadmin_-rollingUpgrade">hdfs dfsadmin -rollingUpgrade finalize</a></code>"
       to finalize the rolling upgrade.</li>
    </ul></li>
  </ol>

  <h4>Upgrading Federated Clusters</h4>
  <p>
    In a federated cluster, there are multiple namespaces
    and a pair of active and standby <em>NNs</em> for each namespace.
    The procedure for upgrading a federated cluster is similar to upgrading a non-federated cluster
    except that Step 1 and Step 4 are performed on each namespace
    and Step 2 is performed on each pair of active and standby <em>NNs</em>, i.e.
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Prepare Rolling Upgrade for Each Namespace</li>
    <li>Upgrade Active and Standby <em>NN</em> pairs for Each Namespace</li>
    <li>Upgrade <em>DNs</em></li>
    <li>Finalize Rolling Upgrade for Each Namespace</li>
  </ol>

  </subsection>

  <subsection name="Upgrade with Downtime" id="UpgradeWithDowntime">
  <p>
    For non-HA clusters,
    it is impossible to upgrade HDFS without downtime since it requires restarting the namenodes.
    However, datanodes can still be upgraded in a rolling manner.
  </p>

  <h4>Upgrading Non-HA Clusters</h4>
  <p>
    In a non-HA cluster, there are a <em>NameNode (NN)</em>, a <em>SecondaryNameNode (SNN)</em>
    and many <em>DataNodes (DNs)</em>.
    The procedure for upgrading a non-HA cluster is similar to upgrading a HA cluster
    except that Step 2 "Upgrade Active and Standby <em>NNs</em>" is changed to below:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Upgrade <em>NN</em> and <em>SNN</em><ol>
      <li>Shutdown <em>SNN</em></li>
      <li>Shutdown and upgrade <em>NN</em>.</li>
      <li>Start <em>NN</em> with the
        "<a href="#namenode_-rollingUpgrade"><code>-rollingUpgrade started</code></a>" option.</li>
      <li>Upgrade and restart <em>SNN</em></li>
    </ol></li>
  </ul>

  <section name="Downgrade and Rollback" id="DowngradeAndRollback">
  <p>
    When the upgraded release is undesirable
    or, in some unlikely case, the upgrade fails (due to bugs in the newer release),
    administrators may choose to downgrade HDFS back to the pre-upgrade release,
    or rollback HDFS to the pre-upgrade release and the pre-upgrade state.
  </p>
  <p>
    Note that downgrade can be done in a rolling fashion but rollback cannot.
    Rollback requires cluster downtime.
  </p>
  <p>
    Note also that downgrade and rollback are possible only after a rolling upgrade is started and
    before the upgrade is terminated.
    An upgrade can be terminated by either finalize, downgrade or rollback.
    Therefore, it may not be possible to perform rollback after finalize or downgrade,
    or to perform downgrade after finalize.
  </p>
  </section>

  <section name="Downgrade" id="Downgrade">
  <p>
    <em>Downgrade</em> restores the software back to the pre-upgrade release
    and preserves the user data.
    Suppose time <em>T</em> is the rolling upgrade start time and the upgrade is terminated by downgrade.
    Then, the files created before or after <em>T</em> remain available in HDFS.
    The files deleted before or after <em>T</em> remain deleted in HDFS.
  </p>
  <p>
    A newer release is downgradable to the pre-upgrade release
    only if both the namenode layout version and the datenode layout version
    are not changed between these two releases.
  </p>

  <subsection name="Downgrade without Downtime" id="DowngradeWithoutDowntime">
  <p>
    In a HA cluster,
    when a rolling upgrade from an old software release to a new software release is in progress,
    it is possible to downgrade, in a rolling fashion, the upgraded machines back to the old software release.
    Same as before, suppose <em>NN1</em> and <em>NN2</em> are respectively in active and standby states.
    Below are the steps for rolling downgrade:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Downgrade <em>DNs</em><ol>
      <li>Choose a small subset of datanodes (e.g. all datanodes under a particular rack).</li>
      <ol>
        <li>Run "<code><a href="#dfsadmin_-shutdownDatanode">hdfs dfsadmin -shutdownDatanode &lt;DATANODE_HOST:IPC_PORT&gt; upgrade</a></code>"
          to shutdown one of the chosen datanodes.</li>
        <li>Run "<code><a href="#dfsadmin_-getDatanodeInfo">hdfs dfsadmin -getDatanodeInfo &lt;DATANODE_HOST:IPC_PORT&gt;</a></code>"
          to check and wait for the datanode to shutdown.</li>
        <li>Downgrade and restart the datanode.</li>
        <li>Perform the above steps for all the chosen datanodes in the subset in parallel.</li>
      </ol>
      <li>Repeat the above steps until all upgraded datanodes in the cluster are downgraded.</li>
    </ol></li>
    <li>Downgrade Active and Standby <em>NNs</em><ol>
      <li>Shutdown and downgrade <em>NN2</em>.</li>
      <li>Start <em>NN2</em> as standby normally. (Note that it is incorrect to use the
        "<a href="#namenode_-rollingUpgrade"><code>-rollingUpgrade downgrade</code></a>"
        option here.)
      </li>
      <li>Failover from <em>NN1</em> to <em>NN2</em>
        so that <em>NN2</em> becomes active and <em>NN1</em> becomes standby.</li>
      <li>Shutdown and upgrade <em>NN1</em>.</li>
      <li>Start <em>NN1</em> as standby normally. (Note that it is incorrect to use the
        "<a href="#namenode_-rollingUpgrade"><code>-rollingUpgrade downgrade</code></a>"
        option here.)
      </li>
    </ol></li>
    <li>Finalize Rolling Downgrade<ul>
      <li>Run "<code><a href="#dfsadmin_-rollingUpgrade">hdfs dfsadmin -rollingUpgrade finalize</a></code>"
       to finalize the rolling downgrade.</li>
    </ul></li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    Note that the datanodes must be downgraded before downgrading the namenodes
    since protocols may be changed in a backward compatible manner but not forward compatible,
    i.e. old datanodes can talk to the new namenodes but not vice versa.
  </p>

    Administrator may choose to first shutdown the cluster and then downgrade it.
    The following are the steps:

  <ol>
      <li>Shutdown all <em>NNs</em> and <em>DNs</em>.</li>
      <li>Restore the pre-upgrade release in all machines.</li>

    <em>Rollback</em> restores the software back to the pre-upgrade release
    but also reverts the user data back to the pre-upgrade state.
    Suppose time <em>T</em> is the rolling upgrade start time and the upgrade is terminated by rollback.

  <p>
    Rollback from a newer release to the pre-upgrade release is always supported.
    However, it cannot be done in a rolling fashion.  It requires cluster downtime.

  <source>hdfs dfsadmin -getDatanodeInfo &lt;DATANODE_HOST:IPC_PORT&gt;</source>
  <p>
    Get the information about the given datanode.
    This command can be used for checking if a datanode is alive
    like the Unix <code>ping</code> command.

  <h4><code>dfsadmin -shutdownDatanode</code></h4>
  <source>hdfs dfsadmin -shutdownDatanode &lt;DATANODE_HOST:IPC_PORT&gt; [upgrade]</source>
  <p>
    Submit a shutdown request for the given datanode.
    If the optional <code>upgrade</code> argument is specified,
    clients accessing the datanode will be advised to wait for it to restart
    and the fast start-up mode will be enabled.
    When the restart does not happen in time, clients will timeout and ignore the datanode.
    In such case, the fast start-up mode will also be disabled.
