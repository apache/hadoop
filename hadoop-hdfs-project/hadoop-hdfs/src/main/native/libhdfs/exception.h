/**
 * Exception handling routines for libhdfs.
 *
 * The convention we follow here is to clear pending exceptions as soon as they
 * are raised.  Never assume that the caller of your function will clean up
 * after you-- do it yourself.  Unhandled exceptions can lead to memory leaks
 * and other undefined behavior.
 *
 * If you encounter an exception, return a local reference to it.  The caller is
 * responsible for freeing the local reference, by calling a function like
 * PrintExceptionAndFree.  (You can also free exceptions directly by calling
 * DeleteLocalRef.  However, that would not produce an error message, so it's
 * usually not what you want.)

/**
 * Exception noprint flags
 *
 * Theses flags determine which exceptions should NOT be printed to stderr by
 * the exception printing routines.  For example, if you expect to see
 * FileNotFound, you might use NOPRINT_EXC_FILE_NOT_FOUND, to avoid filling the
 * logs with messages about routine events.
 *
 * On the other hand, if you don't expect any failures, you might pass
 * PRINT_EXC_ALL.
 *
 * You can OR these flags together to avoid printing multiple classes of
 * exceptions.
