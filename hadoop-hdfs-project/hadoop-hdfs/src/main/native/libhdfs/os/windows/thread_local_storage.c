 * Microsoft Portable Executable and Common Object File Format Specification:
 * http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/gg463119.aspx
 * This technique only works for implicit linking (OS loads DLL on demand), not
 * for explicit linking (user code calls LoadLibrary directly).  This effectively
 * means that we have a known limitation: libhdfs may not work correctly if a
 * Windows application attempts to use it via explicit linking.
