  <property>
    <name>ozone.enabled</name>
    <value>false</value>
    <description>
      Status of the Ozone Object Storage service is enabled.
      Set to true to enable Ozone.
      Set to false to disable Ozone.

  <property>
    <name>ozone.handler.type</name>
    <value>local</value>
    <description>
      The second key dfs.storage.handler.type tells ozone which storage
      handler to use. The possible values are:
      ozone - The Ozone distributed storage handler.
      local - Local Storage handler strictly for testing.

  <property>
    <name>ozone.scm.client.address</name>
    <value></value>
    <description>
      The address of the Ozone SCM client service. This is a required
      setting.

      It is a string in the host:port format. The port number is optional
      and defaults to 9860.

  <property>
    <name>ozone.scm.datanode.address</name>
    <value></value>
    <description>
      The address of the Ozone SCM service used for internal communication
      between the DataNodes and the SCM.

      It is a string in the host:port format. The port number is optional
      and defaults to 9861.

      This setting is optional. If unspecified then the hostname portion
      is picked from the ozone.scm.client.address setting and the
      default service port of 9861 is chosen.

  </property>

  <property>
    <name>ozone.scm.client.bind.host</name>
    <value>0.0.0.0</value>
    <description>
      The hostname or IP address used by the SCM client endpoint to bind.
      This setting is used by the SCM only and never used by clients.

      The setting can be useful in multi-homed setups to restrict the
      availability of the SCM client service to a specific interface.

      The default is appropriate for most clusters.

    <description>
      The hostname or IP address used by the SCM DataNode handler service
      to bind. This setting is used by the SCM only and never used by

      The chunk size defaults to 1MB. If the value configured is more
      than the maximum size (1MB), it will be reset to the maximum
      size.
