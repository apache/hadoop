    This is the template for user-defined EC policies configuration.
    All policies and schemas are defined within the 'configuration' tag
    which is the top level element for this XML document. The 'layoutversion'
    tag contains the version of EC policy XML file format, and user-defined EC
    schemas are included within the 'schemas' tag. The 'policies' tag
    contains all the user defined EC policies, and each policy consists of
    schema id and cellsize.
